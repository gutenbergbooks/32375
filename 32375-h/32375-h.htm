<div class="center"><i>Principal of the American Baptist College, Rangoon, and Senior<br />

Shan literature, and the translator of the<br />

THE AUTHOR</div>


<hr class="front" />
<h2 class="chapter">INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The following stories have been taken from the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
mass of unwritten lore that is to the black-eyed, brown-skinned
boys and girls of the Shan mountain country
of Burma what "Jack the Giant Killer" and "Cinderella"
are to our own children.</p>

<p>The old saw as to the songs and laws of a country
may or may not be true. I feel confident, however,
that stories such as these, being as they are purely
native, with as little admixture of Western ideas as it was
possible to give them in dressing them in their garment
of English words, will give a better insight into what
the native of Burma really is, his modes of thought
and ways of looking at and measuring things, than a
treatise thrice as long and representing infinitely more
literary merit than will be found in these little tales;
and at the same time I hope they will be found to the
average reader, at least, more interesting.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be not out of place to say a little
of the "<i>hpeas</i>" who appear so frequently in these
stories. The <i>hpea</i> is the Burman <i>nat</i>, and is "a being
superior to men and inferior to Brahmas, and having
its dwelling in one of the six celestial regions" (Doctor
Cushing's "Shan-English Dictionary"). They are
universally worshiped by the inhabitants of Burma.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
If a man has fever, the best thing to do is to "<i>ling
hpea</i>," that is, to feed the spirits, and the sufferer
therefore offers rice, betel-nut, painted sticks, etc.
Some kinds of <i>hpeas</i> live in the sacred banyan trees,
and frequently have I seen men, after a long day's
march in the jungle, sit shivering on the ground when
within an arm's length lay good dry fire-wood. It had
fallen, however, from a tree in which lived a <i>hpea</i>, and
not a man would dare touch it. Big combs of honey
may be in the nests of the wild bees, but it is safe from
the hungry traveler if it is sheltered by such a tree.
Some watch over wells, tanks, and lakes, and it is
notorious throughout the Southern Shan States, that a
promising young American missionary, who was
drowned while shooting, met his death by being dragged
to the bottom of the lake by the guardian spirit, who
had become incensed at him for killing a water-fowl on
his domains.</p>

<p>In Shan folk-lore the hero does not "marry and live
happy ever after," but he becomes the king of the
country.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="A_LAUNG_KHIT1" id="A_LAUNG_KHIT1"></a>"A LAUNG KHIT."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="upper">nce</span> upon a time there was a woman who lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the State of Lai Hka. She was a very pious
woman and always gave the best rice and <i>puc</i> to the
priests as they walked, rice <i>chattie</i> in hand, through the
city in the early morning. Every year when the girls
and boys went to the river and filled their chatties with
water to throw over the pagodas and idols to insure a
good rainy season and abundant crops, she always had
the largest bucket of the clearest water and threw it
higher than anybody else. She carried the sweetest
flowers to the <i>zayat</i> every evening, and on worship days
took rice in the prettiest of cups made of banana leaves
and offered to the Gautamas in the idol-house.</p>

<p>But she was not happy. When her neighbors went
to the pagodas they had their little ones tied upon their
backs or running at their sides, but she had no child
whom she could take with her, none to whom she could
tell stories of the great Lord Sa Kyah who rules over
the spirits in the <i>hpea</i> country, and so she was sad.
She was getting old too, and often envied the women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>who lived near who had bright boys to run errands
and girls to help in the house. Each year at the Feast
of Lights, when she sent her little candle floating down
the river, she prayed for a child, but in vain.</p>

<p>At last she made a pilgrimage to a pagoda where
folks said was a <i>parah</i> who would give anything that
was asked of him. Bright and early she set out, and
on her head as an offering she carried an image of a
tiger and one of a man, and when she arrived at the
pagoda she offered the images and prayed for a son.</p>

<p>While she was praying at the pagoda, Lord Sa Kyah
heard her, took pity on her, and promised her a son.
But, alas! when he was born, to his mother's great sorrow,
instead of being the beautiful boy she hoped for he
was nothing but a frog.</p>

<p>Lord Sa Kyah in order to comfort her, however, told
her that her son was really a great <i>hpea</i>, and that after
one year and seven months he would change into the
most handsome man in all the hill and water country.</p>

<p>All the women scoffed and made fun of the poor
mother, and all through the village she was called
Myeh Khit, or "Frog's Mother," but she bore their
jeers in silence and never reviled in return.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 590px; height: 415px;">

</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Now the king of the country had seven daughters.
All were married except one, and one day Myeh Khit
went to him to ask for this daughter in marriage for
her son. The king was of course very angry that she
should ask that his only remaining daughter should
marry a frog, but he spoke deceitfully, called his
daughter and asked her if she would be willing to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a frog for a husband. Like a dutiful daughter
she told him that she would "follow his words" and
do as he wished, as she had no will apart from his.</p>

<p>The king then called the woman and said: "O
woman, I will give my only remaining daughter to your
son, but I make one stipulation. You must build a
road, paved and properly built, from the market-place
to my palace; the sides must be decorated with painted
bamboos, and the work must be done within seven days
or you shall die. Now go, and prepare for the work,
and at the end of the seven days I will make ready the
marriage feast for my daughter or order the executioner
to take off your head."</p>

<p>In great distress Myeh Khit returned to her home
and sat down on the floor of her house and wept. All
day long she bewailed her hopeless condition. In vain
her son asked her the cause of her sorrow. Afraid of
grieving him she would not tell him; but at last when
six out of the seven days had passed, and knowing the
fate that awaited her on the morrow, she told him how
she had gone to the king with her request, and the time
being almost expired, that she must make ready to die
on the morrow.</p>

<p>"The executioner's sword has already been sharpened,
my son," she said, "and to-day in bazaar they
were talking of it, and promising to meet one another
at the palace to-morrow when the sun should be overhead."</p>

<p>As a last resource she made ready food and sweetmeats.
She took paddy and placed it over the fire till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the heat broke the husks and the pure white grains appeared.
These she mixed with the whitest of sugar,
and as she was too poor to own plates, she went into
the jungle to where the new bamboo was bursting
through its green prison, and taking the broad coverings
of the new leaves she fashioned them into dishes
and offered them with many prayers for help to Lord
Sa Kyah.</p>

<p>"Our lord knoweth that my son can do nothing,"
she cried. "He has not even hands to help, and what
can our lord's slave do to avoid the great trouble to
which I have arrived?"</p>

<p>That night in the lovely <i>hpea</i> country the mighty
Lord Sa Kyah reclined on his golden throne of state.
By and by the velvet mat became so hot that he could
sit upon it no longer, and looking down he saw, squatting
before him on the floor, a frog.</p>

<p>"O our lord," said the frog, "I come to remind our
lord that he is his slave's father. My mother, our
lord's slave, has arrived at great sorrow, and unless our
lord pities us and takes compassion on our lord's slave,
she will arrive at destruction to-morrow. Graciously
do this act of kindness, O chief of all the <i>hpeas</i>."</p>

<p>Lord Sa Kyah took pity on his son and promised to
help him. The four strongest spirits in his kingdom
were four <i>hpeas</i>. They were twins and the name of the
first two was Nan Ta Re and that of the second Hte Sa
Kyung. These powerful spirits he ordered to complete
the road during the night.</p>

<p>The next morning when the king arose he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
forth from his palace and a most wonderful sight met
his gaze. He rubbed his eyes, for he believed they deceived
him. He pinched himself to see whether he was
really awake or whether he was dreaming. For a wonderful
thing had happened during the night, so wonderful,
in fact, that one cannot be surprised that he thought
it unreal.</p>

<p>From the bazaar to the very gate of the palace was a
broad, smooth road. On each side were brick walls
covered with the whitest of cement, and decorated with
the heads of lions, and two large griffins, built of brick
and covered also with cement, guarded the entrance.
They were more than twelve cubits high; their mouths
were wide open and showed their terrible fangs, and
their eyes looked upon the king with a stony glare.
The road was paved with blocks of stone cut as smooth
and laid as true as the cells of a honeycomb. There
was one road for men, one for oxen, and yet another
for horses. <i>Zayats</i> had been built here and there so
that travelers aweary could rest and be thankful, and
over all was a wide canopy of white cloth that extended
entirely from end to end and from side to side to protect
the king from the sun when he should move along
the road to observe its wonders more closely.</p>

<p>In utter amazement he beat the gong that hung ready
to his side with such vigor that <i>amats</i>, soldiers, attendants,
and the people from the city, came rushing out of
their houses to the palace gates expecting at least that
the neighboring prince with whom they had long been
at war had taken the city by surprise; but they, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the king, stood transfixed and speechless with wonder
when they saw the road with its carvings and <i>zayats</i> and
the canopy with the golden border spread above all.</p>

<p>The king called Myeh Khit. She came, and hidden
in her turban was her son. The king had thought to
punish this presumptuous woman by giving her an impossible
task to do with a penalty that put her beyond
the power of offending again, and was of course angry
and disappointed that his scheme had been unsuccessful;
but the occurrence had become the common talk of the
market-place, and so he was obliged to carry out his
part of the bargain, although it had gone contrary to
his expectation and desires. So, much against his will,
he called his daughter and gave an order that for seven
days there was to be a feast in honor of the marriage of
the princess.</p>

<p>But when the rejoicings of the people were finished,
Khit was not given permission to live in his father's
palace but was sent with his wife and mother to live in
the old house where he had been born.</p>

<p>Six days after the marriage there was a feast at the
pagoda, and the six daughters of the king went in
state.</p>

<p>They rode upon royal elephants; dancers danced before
them; the golden umbrellas protected them from
the sun; and everybody fell upon their knees and
clasped their hands as the august personages went
along. Their retinue filled the street when they stopped
at the little house where their sister lived.</p>

<p>"O sister," they called, "are you coming to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
feast?" but the poor girl in great shame told them she
could not come, and when they had gone, she sat on the
floor with her face in her hands and gave way to her
grief.</p>

<p>While she was sobbing, her husband approached and
told her not to be sorrowful. "My father is the great
Lord Sa Kyah," said he, "and he will give me anything
I ask, so do not say, 'I am ashamed to go, as I
have only a frog for a husband.' You shall yet see
your proud father and unkind sisters bowing before
you and offering you presents as they offer to gods."</p>

<p>Seeing how distressed the poor girl really was, the
Lord Sa Kyah took pity on them and descended to
earth. He brought with him wonderful white clothes
such as the <i>hpeas</i> wear. They were brighter than the
stars that shoot across the sky at night, or the lightning
that flashes over the heavens during the hot season.
He also gave them a magic stone, which if placed under
their tongues, would enable them to fly wherever they
wished.</p>

<p>The next morning was the last day of the feast when
the boat races would be rowed, when the horses of the
king and his chief <i>amats</i> would race for prizes, when
the best jugglers would show their most wonderful
tricks, and the best dancers would dance under the
booths. In the midst of the fun and excitement a great
shout rent the air: "The mighty Lord Sa Kyah is descending!"
and right in the middle of the feasting
there was a flash of brilliant light and two wonderful
beings alighted. They were clothed in dazzling white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and flew swifter than when a kingfisher darts from a
tree toward its prey in the water.</p>

<p>Every one came crowding around as near as they
dared, and upon their knees offered presents of food to
the wonderful beings.</p>

<p>First and foremost came the princesses, who bowed
till their foreheads touched the dust; they lifted their
clasped hands over their heads and turned away their
faces while they offered the sweetest and most savory
food to the visitors. But it was noticed that although
the spirits ate the food offered by the <i>amats</i> and common
people, they would not eat that given by the princesses,
but wrapped it up and placed it on one side.</p>

<p>The next day the princesses came to their sister's
house and derided her. "O wife of an animal," they
cried, "you would not come to the feast, and so you
lost the chance of seeing the mighty Lord Sa Kyah descend
from the <i>hpea</i> country," and then they told of
the wonderful sight, and again made fun of their unfortunate
sister.</p>

<p>Khit's wife smiled at them and then she said: "It
is you who are unfortunate, not I. My husband is not
the ugly animal you think him to be, but is a great
and powerful <i>hpea</i>. It was not the Lord Sa Kyah who
descended yesterday, but his son, my husband, and myself,
and to prove my words, whose are these?" and she
produced the very bundles of food that her sisters had
offered the day before to the supposed ruler of all
spirits.</p>

<p>The sisters were surprised to see that she had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
food there, but they laughed her to scorn when she told
them of her husband.</p>

<p>In order that his son should become mighty and
famous, the Lord Sa Kyah sent one of his attendants
to the king, and caused him to give an order to his
children that they should have a boat race. The one
who reached the winning post first and carried away
the flag on its rattan pole was to be king in his room,
and the one who came in last was to be slave to the
fortunate one.</p>

<p>There were great preparations among the servants
of the six princesses, and many wagers were made as to
who would be successful, but none wished to wager as
to who would come in last, as all knew it would be the
youngest sister.</p>

<p>"She has no boat," said they, "and has no servants
to make one, or money to buy one. Even if she had,
what could she do? Her husband has no hands, how
could he row against and defeat the swift boatmen who
have been called by the princesses?"</p>

<p>The king gave seven days in which his daughters
were to prepare for the race, and during that time the
shouting of the various crews as they practised on the
lake was heard from early morning till the sun dropped
behind the mountains, but only six boats were seen.</p>

<p>The race was to take place on a lake at the outskirts
of the city, and on the morning of the seventh day,
when the six princesses took their stations they were
surprised to see that there was a seventh boat there, but
they did not know that it was a magic boat sent by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Lord Sa Kyah from the <i>hpea</i> country, and that the sixteen
rowers were not men, but <i>hpeas</i>.</p>

<p>The course was over a thousand cubits to a post,
around it, and return, and so fast did the magic boat
glide through the water that it had covered the entire
distance and the captain had laid the flag at the king's
feet before any of the other boats had reached the first
pole that showed half the distance.</p>

<p>But something even more wonderful than that had
taken place. During the race, the time set apart during
which the son of Myeh Khit was to have the form
of a frog had expired, and, lo! he was now the most
handsome man in all the hill and water country. He
had a crown of gold upon his head, and the magic white
clothes such as only <i>hpeas</i> wear were on his person.
His wife was clothed in as beautiful a manner, and the
king, at last seeing the mistake he had made in treating
him so badly, knelt on the shore and asked: "Which
lord is the son of his slave?" by which he meant, which
of the lords was the one to whom he had given his
daughter.</p>

<p>But the Lord Khit, as he was now called, did not
take a mean revenge on his unkind brothers and sisters,
and when they came on their knees begging for their
lives, and asking the privilege of being his slaves, he
took compassion on them, and instead of ordering them
to immediate execution, made them his <i>amats</i>.</p>

<p>This is why the Shans who live in the hill and water
country worship Sau Maha Khit.</p>


<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="HOW_BOH_HAN_ME_GOT_HIS_TITLE" id="HOW_BOH_HAN_ME_GOT_HIS_TITLE"></a>HOW BOH HAN ME GOT HIS TITLE.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="upper">oh</span> Han Me was one of the greatest generals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
who ever lived in the hill and water country.
Just what his original name was nobody knows now,
but this story tells how he gained his title.</p>

<p>One day he went into the jungle with his wife and
his two children to gather <i>nau</i>, which is a kind of <i>puc</i>
made from the young bamboo shoots. They were very
successful in getting it, and were just on the point of
going home with their loads, when right before them
appeared a large black bear. The bear opened wide
his mouth and roared, showing his immense white teeth
and great throat, and came ambling toward them
growling all the while in the fiercest kind of way.</p>

<p>Now as soon as the man saw the bear he just threw
away all the <i>nau</i> that he had in his hands and ran for
his life, calling on his wife to do the same. The two
children followed their father and left their mother to
get out of her trouble as best she could. She, however,
was as brave as her husband was cowardly, and instead
of running away, she took a handful of the longest of
the shoots and thrust them down the open throat of the
bear and killed him. She then took the short sword
that they had brought from home to cut the shoots, and
with it she skinned the bear, cut him up, and made the
skin into a sack in which to carry the meat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile her cowardly husband did not stop running
till he reached the city in which he lived, and then
he told all his neighbors how he had been in the jungle
and a great bear had attacked them; how he had
fought bravely for a long while, but at last it had killed
his wife and eaten her. The neighbors were very sorry
for him, but advised him to get home and fasten all the
doors and windows before the spirit of his wife would
have time to get in, for they said, seeing that she was
killed when he was with her, her ghost would without
doubt try and gain admittance to the house and haunt
it. Once in, it would be very difficult to get her out.</p>

<p>The man, more frightened than ever, ran home as fast
as he could and called his children to bring all the rice
that was already cooked into the house, and then they
fastened up the two doors and the one window with
bamboos and rattan. There was to be a feast in the
city that night, and the two children wanted to go and
see the fun, but their father was in such a fright that
he would not give them permission to go, or even to
look out through the holes in the sides of the house
where the bamboo matting had come unfastened and
bulged away from the posts.</p>

<p>By this time the sun had set and it was just getting
dark, and the man, tired with the hunt in the jungle
and the excitement after, was just going to sleep when
he heard a voice that he recognized as his wife's calling
to be let in.</p>

<p>"Husband, <i>oie</i>!" it called, "open the door and let
me in. I am very tired and hungry, and want rice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sleep. Get up quickly. Why have you fastened up the
window and doors with bamboos and rattan? There
are no bad men around; any one would think you were
afraid thieves were coming to-night."</p>

<p>The man was frightened almost to death when he
heard his wife's voice, for he felt sure it was her ghost
coming to haunt him, so he called out:</p>

<p>"Ghost of my wife, <i>oie</i>! I will not let you in. If I
did I would never be able to get you out again. You
want to haunt this house. I will not let you in. Go
away, go away!"</p>

<p>In vain the woman told him that she was indeed his
wife, that she was not a ghost at all, but had killed the
bear and had his skin on her back with the meat in it,
and begged to be let in; the man would not believe her
and so she had to wait outside. All night long she
called and begged her husband to let her in, but in
vain. When the sun had risen, however, he felt a little
braver, and so he put his head out through the thatch,
and saw that it really was his wife and not her ghost.
With great joy he ran down, opened the door, and let
her in, but when his wife told him how she had killed
the bear, he again became frightened.</p>

<p>"We have arrived at great trouble," said he.
"When the people hear that you have killed a bear,
they will most surely kill you. What shall we do to
escape and be freed from the impending punishment?"</p>

<p>But his wife was a clever woman, and when the
neighbors came in to ask how it was that she had not
been killed, she told a wonderful story, how through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the bravery of her husband she had been saved; that
he had seen the bear, and by his bravery, that was so
great it was good to marvel at, it had been driven off.
The neighbors were very pleased that so brave a man
lived in their quarter, and he became famous, people
calling him Gon Han Me, or "the man who saw the
bear."</p>

<p>Gon Han Me was very proud of his title, as many
other vain people have been proud of titles they never
earned, but it came near costing him his life, and this
was the way it led him into great danger. One day a
large cobra fell into the well that was in the yard before
the chief door of the king's palace, and everybody
was afraid to draw water because of it. When the
<i>amats</i> told the king that a cobra was in the well, he
gave orders that it was to be taken out, but nobody was
brave enough to go down the well and kill the snake.
The chief <i>amat</i> was in great distress. He feared the
king would deprive him of his office if the snake were
not killed immediately. He was not brave enough to
descend himself, and money, promises, and threats were
of no avail to induce any one else to go. Everybody
declined to take the risk, and said: "Of what use is
money, or horses, or buffaloes, to a man bitten by a
cobra? Will that free him from death? Nay, go
yourself."</p>

<p>The poor <i>amat</i> was at his wits' end, when at last one
of the attendants told the king that in the quarter of
the city where his sister lived, was a man so brave that
he was called Gon Han Me, and said he: "If a man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
brave enough to see a bear in the jungle and not be
afraid, surely he will dare go down the well and kill
the cobra."</p>

<p>The king was much pleased with the attendant for
showing a way out of the difficulty. "He surely is the
man we want," said he; "go and call him immediately
to come and destroy the snake."</p>

<p>The attendant of the king came to Gon Han Me and
said: "Brother, <i>oie</i>! the king has heard that you are
a very brave man, so brave, in fact, that your neighbors
all talk of you and you have arrived at the rank of
being called 'Gon Han Me.' Now in the royal well
there is a snake, a cobra, which as you know is called
the worst snake that lives. It is a very wicked snake
and everybody has arrived at great trouble because of
it. Nobody dares draw water there, and the king has
given orders that it is to be killed. However, no one
at the palace is brave enough to descend the well and
kill the snake, but when his majesty heard of your great
bravery, he sent me to order you to come immediately,
descend the well, and kill the cobra. He will give you
great rewards, and besides will make you a <i>boh</i> (officer)
in the royal army."</p>

<p>When Gon Han Me heard this he was in great distress
and called his wife. "Wife, <i>oie</i>!" he said; "this
unlucky name will certainly be the cause of my death.
It will truly kill me. The king has called me to descend
the royal well and kill a wicked snake that is
frightening everybody in the palace. I am not brave
enough to go. If I do not go, the king will have me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
executed. I shall be killed whichever I do. If I go
the snake will kill me, if I do not go the king will kill
me. I shall arrive at destruction, and all because of
this miserable name."</p>

<p>The wife pondered awhile and then advised her husband
to get dressed in his best clothes and go to the
palace, look down the well to see what it was like, then
make some excuse to come back home and she would
tell him what next to do.</p>

<p>The man was soon dressed in his best clothes, and
was already going down the steps of the house when his
wife called out that he had left his <i>hsan</i> behind him.
Now when the Shans go into the jungle, or on a journey,
they carry with them a rice-bag, or <i>hsan</i>. This is a long
narrow bag, more like a footless hose than anything
else, and when filled with rice it is worn around the
waist, where it looks like a big snake coiled around.
Now Gon Han Me was very proud of his rice-bag, for
instead of being made of plain white cloth, as is the custom,
it was embroidered all over with different colored
wools, and was so long that it went around his waist
several times.</p>

<p>He was so excited and terrified that when he reached
the well he did not notice that one end had been unfastened
and was dragging on the ground, and as he
went to the well to look over, it caught around his legs,
overbalanced him, and he went head first into the well
with a tremendous splash. The next instant the snake
lifting its head darted at him, and all that the men
above, who were waiting with breathless interest to dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>cover
how the battle would end, could hear, was an infinite
amount of splashing, yells, and hissing. Gon
Han Me never knew how it was, but in the fall his <i>hsan</i>
became twisted around the neck of the snake, and in a
few minutes it was choked to death.</p>

<p>The man for a while could hardly believe that the
snake was really dead. It seemed too good to be true,
but he came to the conclusion that his <i>kam</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was good,
and he would yet be a great and famous man. He
therefore assumed a heroic air, and at the top of his
voice called to the men at the mouth of the well:</p>

<p>"Brethren, <i>oie</i>! I have killed the snake and thus
freed you from the great danger from which you were
suffering. I will now throw up the end of this long
rice-bag. Do you catch it and pull me and the dead
snake up to dry ground." He thereupon threw up the
end of the embroidered <i>hsan</i>, the men caught it, and
the next minute he appeared with the dead snake in his
hand.</p>

<p>The king was very pleased with Gon Han Me for his
brave act. He gave him great rewards as he had promised,
and also gave order that in future he should be
known by the name of "Boh Han Me," or "the officer
who saw the bear."</p>

<p>Some time after this there was war between the king
and the ruler of the next province. There was a great
council called and it was unanimously agreed that as
Boh Han Me was the bravest man in the country, he
should be appointed as commander-in-chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p><p>When the message came to his house, however, it
caused him great distress, for as he told his wife, he did
not want to be killed in the least; he did not wish to
run the risk of being killed or even hurt. Besides he
had never been on horseback in his life. He had a
buffalo that ploughed his fields, and it is true that occasionally,
tired with the day's work, he had ridden home
on its back when the sun sank into the west, but he was
sure that if he got on the back of a horse it would immediately
divine that he was ignorant of the art of
riding, did not <i>mau</i> as he said, and he would be thrown
to the ground and hurt, killed maybe. Who could
tell?</p>

<p>Again his clever wife came to the rescue. "You
must go to the fight whether you want to or not," said
she. "The king has given orders and he must be
obeyed. To disobey the king is more dangerous than
seeing a bear or even fighting a snake, so go you must.
As to riding, that is easily managed. Bring your pony
here and I will show you how to ride without danger."</p>

<p>On the never-to-be-forgotten day when the whole
family went into the jungle to gather <i>nau</i>, they were
very poor, but since the fight with the snake in the well,
they had become rich, and so now the <i>boh</i> had servants
to do his bidding, and he therefore called one of them
to saddle his pony and bring it to the door of his house.
This was soon done. He took his seat, and then his
wife took long pieces of rawhide and fastened his legs,
from ankle to knee, on both sides to the stirrups and
girths. She knotted them securely so that there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
be no chance of his falling off his steed. He was very
pleased that he had such a clever wife, who could help
him out of every trouble into which he might fall, and
rode away well pleased with himself, and soon reached
the place where the soldiers were assembled awaiting his
appearance before beginning the march.</p>

<p>To have seen him nobody would have thought that
he was frightened sick. He sat up bravely, and you
would have thought that he was the best horseman in
all the hill and water country, but all the time he was
turning over in his mind the advice given by his wife
when they talked it over the night before. This was
what she said to him: "Now, when you get to the soldiers,
see them start off. Give all the orders in a very
loud, pompous tone. Talk high, and they will think
you <i>mau</i> very much (are very clever). Then you can
easily find some excuse to get to the rear, and you must
stay there till the fighting is all finished."</p>

<p>There was one party to this arrangement, however,
that they had both failed to take into account when
making their plans, and that was the pony. They
neither remembered that there was a possibility of the
pony taking it into his head to carry his master where
the latter did not want to go, but that was just what
happened, for, when the pony saw all the other horses
and the men marching off, he too commenced to move
forward. He was a fine big pony and was accustomed
to head processions, not to come at the tail end, and so
he started off of his own accord. Now we have said that
his rider had never been on horseback before, but had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
often ridden his buffalo from the paddy field when the
day's work of ploughing was over. When a man on a
buffalo wishes to stop, he jerks the rope that is fastened
to the animal's nose, and obedient to the signal, it stops.
So, when the <i>boh</i> found his steed forging ahead a little
faster than suited him, he jerked the reins, expecting
the pony to stop, but to his consternation, he found it
go all the faster. He jerked harder, the pony broke
into a quick trot. He jerked again, the pony began to
gallop. He was now thoroughly frightened and called
out at the top of his voice, but this only frightened the
pony more and it began to gallop just as fast as ever it
could, and worse than all, it headed straight for the
enemies' soldiers, whom he could see in the distance getting
ready to receive him. He cursed his wife with all
his heart. If he could only fall off! She had taken
too good precautions against that. He pulled and
tugged, but the rawhide was strong; the knots were too
tight; and every minute brought him nearer to his enemies.
He could hear the shouts of his friends in the
distance getting fainter and fainter as the distance increased,
calling him to come back. How he wished
he could! He swayed from side to side, first on
one flank then on the other. The pony now had its
head down between its knees, the bit between its teeth,
and was tearing along like the wind. It would be hard
to say which was the more frightened, the horse or its
rider; each frightened the other. But there was a
lower depth yet to be reached. In jumping over a hole
the saddle slipped to the side, the next instant away it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
went, turned, and saddle, rider, and all slipped clear
around, and Boh Han Me found himself still securely
lashed to the saddle, squarely under his horse instead
of on it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the camp of the enemy a council of war
was being held. "Can any one tell me," asked the
king, "who commands our foes?"</p>

<p>"Our lord," said one of the <i>amats</i>, "it is a man who
has been picked out of the whole army, and is the
bravest man who ever drew a sword. He is called Boh
Han Me because he conquered a great fierce bear in the
jungle. He also went down a well in the royal palace
and killed the largest and fiercest snake ever seen in all
the hill and water country."</p>

<p>The king was much disquieted when he heard of the
prowess of this man, and was pondering whether it
would not be better to fight with silver than steel, and
offer a great reward to any man in the enemies' camp
who would bring to him the head of this doughty soldier,
when he heard a great shout. He sprang to the
tent door and looked anxiously out. All eyes were
bent in one direction and a look of intense wonder, not
unmixed with fear, sat on each face. The king naturally
expected to see the whole army of the enemy approaching
in overwhelming numbers, but he shared the
wonder of his soldiers when he saw, not an army, but
one single man dashing toward him. The next instant
the rider disappeared entirely, but the horse came on
faster than before. Next instant there was the rider
again, arms tossing in the air, hair streaming behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
only to disappear the following moment in the same
mysterious way.</p>

<p>The face of the king blanched with terror as he asked
in a whisper, "Who is this man?"</p>

<p>A hundred voices cried: "It is Boh Han Me, the
bravest man alive! He has some charm that makes
him invisible whenever he wishes, and he cannot be hurt
by sword or arrow."</p>

<p>Nothing spreads so quickly as a panic, and almost
before the king was aware of it, he was carried away in
the fierce rush to escape. His men were blind with
fear; they threw away their arms; men and officers fled
for their lives, their only thought to flee from that horse
and its terrible rider who disappeared and reappeared
in such an awful fashion, and in a few minutes the field
was deserted and the whole army in full retreat.</p>

<p>The horse by this time was exhausted. It stumbled,
but regained its feet only to fall again immediately. It
made another effort to struggle to its feet, but this time
unsuccessfully, and then lay still on its side, its flanks
heaving and its breath coming and going in quick sobs.
Very cautiously Boh Han Me drew a knife and slowly
cut one knot. The horse did not stir. Another followed,
and soon one leg was freed. This made the task
easier, and soon both legs were cut from their bonds and
he sprang to his feet, bruised and sore, it is true, but no
bones broken, and only too glad to be on solid earth
again, and he vowed he would never from that day
forth ever get on anything that moved faster than a
buffalo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>What the king said when he reached the place where
the foes had encamped may be imagined. He declared
that a man as brave as his general had never lived in
any age or country. For one man to charge a whole
army, and, what was more, drive it off too, was a thing
good to marvel at, and Boh Han Me did the wisest
thing he ever did in his life, he just held his peace.
When they had gathered together the spoil they returned
home with the hero by the side of the king. The latter
gave him a grand palace with gold, silver, oxen, buffaloes,
elephants, and slaves in abundance, and also the
rank of Boh Hoh Sök, which is the highest rank of general
in the army, and means, "head of all the troops."
The happy man lived many, many years, but he kept
his promise, and whenever he wished to travel he rode
upon an elephant and never again as long as he lived
got upon the back of a horse.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="THE_TWO_CHINAMEN" id="THE_TWO_CHINAMEN"></a>THE TWO CHINAMEN.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="upper">ges</span> ago, when this world was new, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
created but a short while, two Chinese boys left
their native country and started out on their travels to
discover things new and strange. After wandering for
many days they came to the hill and water country
where the Shans live. Here they found a monastery,
where lived very wise and learned priests, who instructed
them in many ways.</p>

<p>They lived here some time and won the esteem of the
head priest to such an extent that he showed them a
magic sword and bow that had lain in the monastery
many years waiting for somebody to carry away. The
law was that the man who could bend the bow or could
draw the sword from its sheath should keep it.</p>

<p>The elder brother went to the sword and tried to
draw it. He pulled, he tugged, he strained, till the
sweat ran down his face, but in vain. He could not
draw it out one inch.</p>

<p>Seeing the ill success of his elder brother, the younger
thought it impossible for him to draw the magic sword,
but at his brother's command he took the handle in his
hand and pulled with all his might. To everybody's
surprise out came the magic sword, and the Chinaman
walked away in triumph.</p>

<p>The elder brother now made up his mind that if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
could not get the sword he would try for the bow, and
he might have more success with that, so he exerted all
his strength, and slowly, slowly bent it, till the cord
was taut and the bow all ready to shoot.</p>

<p>The people of the city were amazed that the two
brothers should have such strength and good luck, and
many envious eyes followed them as they again set out
on their journey, carrying their trophies with them.</p>

<p>They traveled on and on till they gave up counting
the distance, it was so great, till one day, as they were
resting on the banks of a large river in a far country,
they saw a great fish swimming in the water. It was
so great that nobody heretofore had been able to catch
it, and it was in fact the king of all the fishes. It
broke all the nets and smashed all the traps. It
snapped all the lines that were set for it, and nobody
was strong enough to pull it ashore when it did
take the hook. The Chinamen saw it, and the elder
brother instantly strung his bow, put on a bolt, and
shot the great fish as it was swimming in the shallow
water. In a few minutes he had it on his shoulder,
and they commenced to cross the bridge to the other
side of the river.</p>

<p>Now the river was very wide, the current was very
swift, and the bridge was not at all strong. It was
only made of bamboos and rattan and swung from side
to side as the men crossed it. When they got to the
middle it began to creak and strain till the two travelers
were in great fear it would break. The one who
had killed it turned to his brother and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"O brother, the fish is so heavy I am afraid the
bridge will break. Please draw your magic sword and
cut it in halves, and then we will be able to get to the
other side in safety."</p>

<p>The younger brother therefore drew his sword and
cut the fish in halves; but he did not yet know how
sharp the sword was, for he cut the fish in halves, it is
true, but not only that, but the whole bridge as well,
so that his brother fell into the water and was immediately
swept from his sight. On his part he could not
of course cross, now the bridge was down, so he returned
to the same side of the river and ran along the
bank looking to see whether his brother would be swept
ashore in some shallow place; but although he ran till
he was exhausted and then traveled for many days by
the side of the river through the jungle, he could discover
no trace of his lost brother.</p>

<p>Swiftly down the stream his brother was carried.
He tried to swim first to one bank and then to the
other as the current swept him along, but in vain. At
last he gave up trying. Nobody knows just how long
he was in the water, but for many days he floated, and
when he was on the point of dying from exhaustion,
cold, and hunger, his feet touched bottom, and, more
dead than alive, he crawled up the bank to dry land.</p>

<p>He found that he had landed near a garden, and, on
climbing over the wall, he discovered that it belonged
to the king. He was too tired to climb back again,
however, so sank on the ground and the next instant
fell asleep from sheer weariness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it happened that the king of that country had
just died, and his <i>amats</i> had taken out the royal chariot
and were drawing it around the city looking for the
proper person to become king. As they went along
they saw this young man sleeping in the royal garden
with his magic bow beside him. He had come from
nobody knew where. He was so strong that the river
even could not kill him. Above all, he had a wonderful
magic bow which none of the <i>amats</i> or nobles could
bend, so they came to the conclusion that he indeed
was the man who should be king of the country, and
he was crowned with great pomp and magnificence.</p>

<p>The other brother had been left standing on the
bridge when the elder fell into the water, as we have
said, and for many days he followed the river bank till
he too arrived in a far country. It was a very strange
country. There were no men there, only monkeys, but
they were the very cleverest monkeys that ever lived,
and were ruled over by a <i>nang me prah</i>, that is, a
queen, just as men are ruled. This queen of the monkeys
fell in love with the Chinaman and married him,
so that he became king of Monkey Land. They built
a palace for him on the top of the highest tree in the
jungle. Every seventh day they brought him food.
Some brought plantains, some mangoes, some rice, and
some fish fresh caught in the river.</p>

<p>The elder brother had now been king of the country
where he had landed for some years, and one day he
remembered his younger brother, whom he had left
standing on the broken bridge with the sword in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hand. He therefore called his <i>amats</i> and told them he
was going on a long journey, and that they must rule
well and justly till he returned. He then called his
favorite servants and set out to discover his brother.
They had a great store of provisions carried by coolies.
He had his royal elephants, on which he could ride
when traveling over the steep mountain roads and to
carry his chief queens, and ponies for riding over the
plains.</p>

<p>One night, however, he became separated from his
followers and lost his way. He shouted and called, but
shouted and called in vain. He could not find a trace
of them. Servants, horses, elephants, and goods were
all gone, and he was in great fear that he would die in
the jungle. When morning broke he was much surprised
to see that he had arrived at a city, but that the
houses were all built on the tops of the trees, and on
looking closer, he discovered that instead of people
living in these houses the inhabitants were all large
monkeys. Not a man was to be seen, and the monkeys
were very fierce and screamed at him in anger from the
top of every tree. One especially he noticed as being
more fierce than any of the others, and he accordingly
leveled his magic bow and shot it dead. As it fell
from the tree to the ground he heard all the friends of
the dead monkey come rushing out of their houses on
the tops of the trees calling to one another that a man
had killed one of their brethren, and asking that their
friends would come to kill the man who had been guilty
of the deed.</p>

</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>After a little time the king came to a tree that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
taller than any other in the jungle, and upon it was a
palace. Stairs led from the door of the palace to the
ground, and as he looked more closely he saw a man
up there. In great joy he called out to him, asking to
be directed. "I am the king of a far country," he
said, "and I am on a journey to search for my brother,
whom I have not seen for many, many years. Last
night I lost my way. Will you take pity on me and
show me the way and I will give you a great reward?"</p>

<p>"Who was your brother?" asked the man in the
tree.</p>

<p>"He was a Chinese student," returned the king,
"and he had a wonderful magic sword. One day as
we were traveling he cut a great fish in two, but such
was the virtue residing in the magic sword that he not
only cut the fish in halves but the bridge as well, so I
left him standing on the end of the bridge."</p>

<p>You may imagine how pleased the king was when he
discovered that the man standing at the top of the tree
was the long-lost brother for whom he was searching,
and he made ready to ascend to his house in the treetop.</p>

<p>At that moment a little monkey ran down the tree
toward him, and he kicked it aside, saying, "Out of
my way, little monkey."</p>

<p>The small monkey in great anger said: "I am not a
monkey, but your nephew."</p>

<p>"My nephew!" exclaimed the king in great astonishment.
"What do you mean by that?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>His brother, the monkey king, then explained to
him that he had married the queen of all the monkeys
and that this was their child, that he ruled over all the
monkeys, who had built this palace for him and every
seventh day brought him tribute of food.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, then," said the elder brother,
"that I have killed one of your subjects," and at the
same moment the wife and son of the dead monkey approached
their king.</p>

<p>"Our lord," said they, "the man yonder has been
guilty of a great crime. He entered the domains of our
lord and although we did nothing to him, yet he raised
his bow and killed one of the servants of our lord.
Therefore our lord's servants demand that he shall be
killed too."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said the king of the monkeys,
"that you have killed that special monkey. He was
very clever and brave. He was also one of my chief
<i>amats</i>, and his friends will assuredly kill you."</p>

<p>The monkeys were now assembling by hundreds and
calling to each other everywhere. Every treetop appeared
alive with angry figures all calling for vengeance
on the man who had killed their friend.</p>

<p>The king, however, who had taken sides with his
brother, was not afraid, and said he could kill all the
monkeys in the country; and he drew his sword and
cut in halves the monkey nearest to him. To his
great surprise, however, the two halves of the monkey
he had killed each became a whole monkey and
attacked him again, so that he now had two to fight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>stead
of one. If he cut off the hand or leg of a
monkey with his long sword, it immediately turned
into two, and he soon saw that unless he devised some
other way of fighting them they would soon kill them
both.</p>

<p>He therefore rushed off to the jungle and got a great
hollow bamboo. He then went to a bees' nest and
swept all the bees into it, and caught a great many scorpions
and centipedes, snakes and spiders. When the
monkeys came toward him to renew the fight, he opened
one end of the bamboo and the insects and reptiles,
swarming out, very angry at being kept prisoners in the
hollow bamboo, soon drove the monkeys off so that the
two brothers were able to escape. Shortly afterward
they found the escort of the king and together returned
to the city where the good elder brother made the
younger his chief <i>amat</i>.</p>

<p>Now when the younger brother became <i>amat</i>, he of
course saw what a great king his brother was. He saw
his subjects kneel before him; he saw the royal elephants,
oxen, horses, and buffaloes; he saw the riches
in money, jewels, and goods that belonged to him; that
his queens were the most beautiful women in the land;
and he became jealous. Then he coveted all these
things. The next step was easy; he determined to kill
his brother and become king in his stead. Then he
began to ponder and plot how best he could destroy the
brother who had been so good to him. He did not remember
how that same brother had left all these things
to come and hunt for him; how he had given him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
riches and honor and position, so that now he was chief
minister and next to him in power. No, he did not
think of any of these things, but like the ungrateful
man that he was, thought only that his brother had
more than he.</p>

<p>He soon came to the conclusion that he could not
kill his brother in the city, for everybody loved the
king, and he feared that his crime would be discovered,
so he was obliged to wait until they should be alone in
the jungle together. The opportunity soon came.
One day the king was out hunting and had gotten
separated from all his followers. His brother the <i>amat</i>
was a short distance ahead when he saw, just in front of
him, a very deep hole, so deep in fact that it was impossible
to see the bottom. In great excitement he
turned and beckoned to the king as fast as he could,
calling out in a loud voice that he had something very
wonderful to show him.</p>

<p>The king thought that at least he had discovered a
mountain of rubies and came running up. He knelt
by the side of the hole but could see nothing.</p>

<p>"There is nothing down there," said he.</p>

<p>"Let our lord lean a little farther over," said the
cunning <i>amat</i>. "He will then see the most wonderful
thing in the world."</p>

<p>The king bent farther over and his wicked brother
gave him a push that sent him headlong to the bottom.</p>

<p>He had now succeeded in all his plans; he had
reached the height of his ambitions, but although he
became king he was not happy. He had trouble all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the time. It is true he had his brother's riches, that he
rode the royal elephants, wore the royal robes, and
lived in the royal palace, but he had trouble with his
<i>amats</i>, with his soldiers, and his people, and therefore
instead of being happy as he expected he would be, he
was unhappy and miserable.</p>

<p>If he had only known what was happening in the
jungle he would have been more anxious still. His
brother was not dead as he thought. The fall to the
bottom of the hole did not kill him and he was only a
prisoner. His followers had all gone back to the city
with his wicked brother. He called, but called in vain.
He heard nothing but the echo of his own cries, and
he was about to give up in despair, when it happened
that the mighty Lord Sa Kyah coming through the
jungle heard his cries and inquired the cause. The
king did not know that this was the Lord Sa Kyah, but
told him all that had happened. Lord Sa Kyah was
very angry with the king's heartless brother and created
at the bottom of the hole a lily of the kind that has a
very long stalk. The king sat upon the blossom of the
lily which then began to grow very rapidly, and as it
grew carried the king up toward the mouth of the hole.</p>

<p>As he gradually rose toward daylight he saw that a
tree was growing at the very edge of the pit, and that
some of the branches hung over. He saw also that a
monkey was busily engaged in feeding on the leaves and
fruit. The lily, of course, made no noise as it pursued
its upward path; the king also kept quiet so as not to
frighten the monkey, and when he was near enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
suddenly put forth his hand and caught it by the tail.
The monkey screamed and kicked, fought and scratched,
but in vain; the king held on, and at last the monkey
climbed down the tree taking the king with him, and
the latter was speedily standing once more on solid
ground and able to offer up his thanks to the mighty
Lord Sa Kyah.</p>

<p>The king was not long in reaching the city and when
he arrived, to his great sorrow he saw, as he expected,
his ungrateful brother reigning, while the people all sorrowed
for their old king. He determined to wait
awhile before he declared himself, feeling that the Lord
Sa Kyah who had already once helped him when in
trouble and danger would aid him in regaining his lost
kingdom; so he went into the poorest part of the city,
put on the poorest and most ragged clothes that he
could find, and sat near the gate of the city begging,
from whence he often saw his brother riding by in state.</p>

<p>One day the heralds came riding by and stood in the
open space fronting the market where the gambling
booths are, and gave notice that the king had commanded
that if anybody could bend the magic bow belonging
to the late king, his brother, he was to be
made the chief <i>amat</i> of the kingdom and receive many
and great presents besides.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the next day there was a great
crowd gathered together at the great gate of the palace,
waiting for the king. At last out he came with all his
ministers and followed by attendants bearing golden
umbrellas. Behind him came a soldier carrying over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
his shoulder the magic bow which was placed at the
king's feet. The king called upon his soldiers to come
and bend the bow, and the strongest of them came forward,
but although they pulled and tugged, tugged and
strained, they could not bend it. Then the people of
the city, or "the king's people," as they loved to call
themselves in contradistinction to the people who lived
in the jungle villages, tried, but met with no better success
than the soldiers. They could not bend the bow.
The king then ordered the <i>amat löng</i> to call the men
from the jungle. The very strongest coolies, those who
carried heavy burdens over the mountains, came in answer
to the king's summons, but although some of them
could carry fifty <i>soie</i> over the highest mountain they
could not draw the cord a hand's-breadth.</p>

<p>The king, much disappointed, was about to return to
the palace when a beggar man approached and bowing
at his feet said he was able to draw the bow and fire an
arrow from it. The king was angry at what he thought
was the presumption of this beggar. The soldiers derided
him, saying that the bravest of them could not
draw the bow and how was a beggar to do it? The
coolies also asked him whether he could carry fifty <i>soie</i>
over Loi Mawk Pah that was called the Cloud Mountain,
because its head was often in the clouds. But the
beggar asked to be allowed to try and the king gave
orders that he should be given the bow, at the same
saying that he assuredly should be made <i>amat löng</i> if
he was successful, but if he could not bend the bow, he
should be put to death immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The beggar assented to these terms and seized the
bow. He took hold of the string and without any
show of strength pulled it a hand's-breadth, and then
as the king and his courtiers looked on in amazement he
pulled it to its full length, placed the string on the
ivory trigger, put an arrow on it, and asked the king
where he should shoot.</p>

<p>"Straight up into the air," said the king. The
beggar raised the bow, twang went the string, and the
arrow whizzed out of sight. Everybody stood looking
up into the sky when suddenly one of the courtiers
gave a warning cry. It came too late. The arrow had
gone straight up, turned, and fell almost on the same
spot from whence it was shot. Almost, but not quite,
for in its fall it struck the upturned face of the king
and he fell dead.</p>

<p>A great cry was raised as the king fell and the
guards rushed forward to seize the beggar and lead him
to immediate execution, but he waved them off with a
gesture of his hand. The next instant his rags fell
from him and he stood before them in the royal robes
of a king.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the younger brother, although indeed
he had not murdered his brother the king, yet did
kill him in his thoughts and intentions, and he suffered
the punishment that is always meted out to the man
who kills his fellow.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="STORY_OF_THE_PRINCESS_NANG_KAM_UNG" id="STORY_OF_THE_PRINCESS_NANG_KAM_UNG"></a>STORY OF THE PRINCESS NANG KAM UNG</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">here</span> was once a king who reigned over one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the largest States in the hill and water country.
For a long time there had been war between him and
the <i>sau hpa</i> of the neighboring State, but at last his
soldiers had been successful, and his enemy had been
driven out of his possessions, which had thereupon been
added to his own. A great feast had been given when
his soldiers returned to their homes, and he was now
sitting with his queens and his seven daughters in the
palace watching a performance given in honor of the
victory. He praised the actors for their skill, and then
asked his daughters whether they had enjoyed the performance.
They one and all assured him that they
had enjoyed it much, and then turning to them he
continued:</p>

<p>"That is right, my daughters, enjoy yourselves to-day
and to-morrow and all through your lives. You
are the daughters of a mighty king, and it is your lot
to be happy and enjoy yourselves all your lives, therefore
again I say enjoy yourselves and be happy."</p>

<p>The eldest of the daughters, who was a perfect courtier
said: "O our lord, our luck is fortunate, because
it depends on that of the lord our father, and who is so
fortunate as he?"</p>

<p>The king was very pleased with the flattery of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
daughter, and promised to grant any request she would
make of him.</p>

<p>The youngest daughter, however, was young and
foolish, and had not yet learned the truth that in a
king's presence it is not well always to say what one
thinks, and therefore she said to her sister: "Your
luck may depend on the luck of the lord our father,
but mine is my own and depends upon myself alone."</p>

<p>When the king heard this he was very angry that
one of his daughters, and she the youngest too, should
have the presumption to say that she depended for anything
at all on any other than he, and he determined
to punish her.</p>

<p>For a long time he pondered on the best way to do
this and at last devised a plan which, if severe, was at
least novel.</p>

<p>He called his <i>amats</i> to go throughout the whole land
and search for the poorest man in all his kingdom, and
when they had found him they were to bring him to
the palace and he would marry his youngest daughter
to him, and then, said he, "We will see about luck
after that."</p>

<p>Day after day the heralds searched the land but they
could not find a man poor enough to suit the king.
All who were brought before him acknowledged that
they had something valuable, either a little money, a
precious stone, or a distant relative who was rich and
from whom they could borrow a little if necessary. A
man of this description would not suit the angry king.
He wanted one poorer than that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the <i>amat löng</i>, or chief minister, brought a
man before him and said that he was the poorest in all
the land. His name was Ai Du Ka Ta. He was a
woodseller in the bazaar, who every day went into the
jungle and picked up the dead branches of the trees
that had fallen to the ground, and brought them to the
market every fifth day to sell. So poor was he that he
did not even own the sword that is the almost inseparable
companion of the Shan and is used, among other
things, to cut down the small trees that are left to dry
for firewood, so he had to be content to pick up the
small branches that he found under the trees, and got
a proportionately small price when he carried his load
into the bazaar.</p>

<p>When he appeared before the king, his trousers were
all fringed at the bottom where they had been torn by
the thorns in the jungle. His turban months before
had been white, but now it was a deep gray; it was only
half its original length and was full of holes. Jacket
he had none, and when the king asked him how many
blankets he had upon his bed at home to keep him
warm at night when the cold wind brought the rain up
the valley, he answered sorrowfully, "Not one, our
lord." He had no relative except an old mother whom
he was obliged to support, and who was known throughout
the district in which she lived as the woman with
the bitterest tongue in all the land, and when too sick
to move from her mat, she would yet fill the air with
poisoned words.</p>

<p>The king was very pleased with his <i>amat löng</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
finding Ai Du Ka Ta, and gave him a very fine horse
as a reward. Then he called his daughter, took away
all her fine clothes and married her to this poorest man
in his realm and drove her out of the palace amid the
jeers and taunts of the very people who, before her disgrace,
had waited upon her every word and had done
her bidding while they trembled before her. The king
also took away her old name and commanded that in
future she was to be known as Nang Kam Ung, which
means, "The woman whose luck depends upon herself."</p>

<p>The house, or rather hut, to which Ai Du Ka Ta
took his bride was in the jungle. It was only four
bamboo poles stuck in the ground and covered with
dried grass and bushes. Not even a sleeping mat was
on the ground&mdash;there was no floor&mdash;and the chattie in
which he cooked his rice had a hole in it, and had to
be set upon three stones sideways over the fire with the
hole uppermost, to prevent the water leaking and putting
out the fire.</p>

<p>Fortunately the girl's mother had helped her to
smuggle out her "birth-stone," which was a large,
valuable ruby, and so she took it off her finger and
gave it to her husband, telling him to go and sell it
and buy clothes and food for both of them.</p>

<p>Ai looked at the stone and said, "Who will give me
food and clothes for a little red stone like that? We
have no fools or mad men living near here who would
do such a foolish thing as that," for you must remember
he had lived in the jungle all his life, and had never
heard of precious stones, much less seen one till now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>His friends were just as ignorant of its value as he was.
He went from house to house in the little village near,
but all laughed at him till he became disgusted, threw
the stone away in the jungle and came home in a very
ill humor with his wife for leading him such a wild-goose
chase, and making him appear foolish in the eyes
of the few people he knew.</p>

<p>His wife was in great distress when she found that he
had thrown the ruby away, and told her husband that
if he had gone to the city and taken it to the jewelers,
instead of to the ignorant people in the jungle, they
would have given him in return enough money to keep
them in food and clothing all the hot season and build
a new house into the bargain.</p>

<p>Ai looked at her and said: "Indeed, that is a thing
good to marvel at. Why, I know where there are
coolie-basket loads of such red stones in the dry bed of
a river near where I gather sticks for fire-wood in the
jungle, waiting for anybody to carry away, and I never
thought them worth the labor of taking to the bazaar."</p>

<p>The princess was full of joy when she heard this, and
the next morning they borrowed two coolie baskets from
a man in the village. Bright and early they went to
the river bed, and there, even as Ai had said, were
basket loads of fine rubies. They gathered them up
carefully and buried most of them, covering over the
hole with a flat stone, so that no one would discover
their hoard, and then the princess, picking out a double
handful of the largest and clearest ones, sent them to
her father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The king, when he saw the jewels, instead of being
pleased, fell into a great passion, called the unfortunate
<i>amat löng</i> into his presence, and after rating him
soundly, deprived him of all his goods, houses, and
lands, deposed him from office, and drove him from his
presence as poor as Ai himself had been.</p>

<p>"I ordered you to call a poor man," roared the king
to the trembling man before him. "I said he was to
have no goods or property at all, and here the very
next day he sends me a double handful of the very best
rubies I ever saw in my life."</p>

<p>In vain the culprit assured the king that the day before
Ai was certainly the poorest man in the whole
kingdom, and complained that the jewels must have
been the work of some <i>hpea</i>, whom he had unwittingly
offended, and who had therefore determined on his ruin
in revenge. The king would listen to no excuse, and
the unhappy <i>amat</i> was glad to crawl from his presence
before resentment had carried him to the length of ordering
his execution.</p>

<p>The very next night a wonderful golden deer entered
the royal garden where the king was accustomed to sit
when it became too warm in the palace, and after doing
an immense amount of mischief, eating favorite flowers,
and otherwise destroying and ruining the garden, it
leaped over the fence and disappeared in the early
morning fog, just as the guards were arousing themselves
from sleep. It was in truth not a golden deer as
the guards had told the king, but a <i>hpea</i> that had assumed
this form; but the king not knowing this ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
his heralds to go through the city immediately and call
upon all the inhabitants to come early next morning to
help their lord catch it. Ai was summoned with the
rest of the people. He had no horse, but going to the
city gate that day he saw that a race between horses
belonging to the king was about to be run. Ai was a
good horseman, and asked the head horse-feeder of the
king to let him ride one of the animals. He rode, and
rode so well that he won the race, and that official was
so pleased with him that he promised to grant him any
request in his power. Ai asked for the privilege of
riding the same horse at the hunt next day, and the request
was readily granted, and thus it happened that,
next morning when he went to the place appointed, he
rode a horse that was faster than any other there except
the one the king himself rode.</p>

<p>The people were divided into four parties; one toward
the north, one toward the south, one east, and one
west. The king stationed himself with the party at
south, and the <i>amats</i> were at the north, and when the
deer was at last driven out of the jungle by the beaters
it headed toward the king and dashed by him at great
speed.</p>

<p>The <i>hpea</i> that had taken the form of the deer wished
to have some fun at the king's expense, and therefore
kept ahead just where the king could see him all the
while, sometimes but a cubit or two away from him,
and then when the country was open, darting far in
advance. So swiftly did they go that in a few minutes
the men on foot were left behind, and after a while all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
except those upon the very fastest horses were distanced,
till at last only the king and Ai were left, the
latter but a little behind the king. All day long the
chase continued till, just as the sun was setting and
men and horses were both exhausted, the deer made
straight for a precipice that appeared to block the path
on each hand as far as the eye could reach. The king
was congratulating himself that the deer could not possibly
escape now, when he saw right before him an
opening in the rock, and the next instant the <i>hpea</i> disappeared
in the cave and the king was obliged to give
up the chase, for even if his horse could have carried
him any farther, which it could not, the cave was so
dark that nothing could be seen inside.</p>

<p>The king fell from his horse almost dead with fatigue,
and managed to crawl under a wide-spreading banyan
tree that grew near. The only other person there was
Ai, and he, coming to the king, massaged his limbs till
the tired monarch fell asleep. After a while he awoke
and Ai asked him to eat some rice he had prepared,
but the king said he was too tired to eat anything; but
at last he managed to eat a little sweet, glutinous rice
that the princess had cooked in a hollow piece of bamboo
and given to her husband before he set out that
morning.</p>

<p>The king was very grateful and asked Ai his name;
but the latter was afraid to tell what his real name was,
so, as his mother years before had been in the habit of
selling betel-nut in the bazaar, he told the king that
his name was Sau Boo, or betel-nut seller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The king was very pleased with him and promised
him great rewards when they got back to the palace;
but in a few minutes he had dropped asleep again, and
Ai sat alone keeping guard.</p>

<p>It was very fortunate that he too did not go to sleep,
for as every one knows, the banyan is a sacred tree,
and this one was inhabited by a <i>hpea</i> who was noted
for being one of the cruelest and most dreaded spirits in
all the land. Ai roused the king and told him there
was a <i>hpea</i> in the tree and begged him not to sleep
there for it would assuredly kill them both before morning.</p>

<p>The king said, "Wake me not, trouble me not.
From my head to my feet, I am nothing but aches and
pains. Were I to move I should die. I may as well
die at the hands of the <i>hpea</i>." So saying he fell asleep
again, and Ai did not dare to disturb him, but watched
all night long.</p>

<p>During the night Ai heard the <i>hpea</i> grumbling to
himself several times and promising himself the pleasure
of killing them on the morrow, so he pretended to be
asleep so that he could hear what the <i>hpea</i> said and if
possible thwart him.</p>

<p>"These mortals have presumed to sleep under my
tree," he heard him say, "but it shall be the last time
they sleep anywhere. Let me see," he continued,
"how shall I kill them? Which will be the best way?
Ah, I know. Early to-morrow when they get ready to
leave, I will break the tree in two, and the top shall
fall on them. If, however, they escape, I will saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
through the supports of the first bridge, so that it will
break when they are in the middle, and they will fall
to the bottom of the valley below. Then if that should
fail, I will loosen the stones of the arch of the city gate
so that it will fall on them as they pass underneath,
and if that does not kill them, when the king arrives at
his palace and being thirsty with his long ride calls for
water, I will change the water in the goblet to sharp
needles that will stick in his throat and kill him. If
he does not drink the water, however, he will assuredly
be very tired and will go to sleep immediately, and I
will send an immense rat into his room that will kill
him without doubt."</p>

<p>Having finished making his plans, the <i>hpea</i> left the
tree and started the work of preparing the different
traps for the mortals who had enraged his hpeaship by
daring to sleep under the tree, and thus profane his
home.</p>

<p>The king was frightened half to death when he awoke
next morning, and found that he had been sleeping all
night under the tree of that special <i>hpea</i>; but Ai, or
Sau Boo as the king called him, told him not to be
frightened for he could save his life if the king would
only follow his advice and do as he told him.</p>

<p>The king promised to follow his words implicitly, and
also promised him unheard-of rewards if he only helped
him to get to his palace in safety.</p>

<p>The first danger was the tree, and so Ai got their
horses ready and under the pretense of allowing them
to eat grass before setting out on their journey, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
gradually worked them nearer and still nearer the
edge of the tree, and then, with one bound, they both
galloped out from under it. At the same instant there
was a great crash and the whole top of the tree fell to
the ground. So near did it fall on them that the king's
turban was torn from his head by one of the upper
branches, but beyond this no harm was done.</p>

<p>Next, instead of riding over the bridge, they went
along the bank a little distance, and soon found a place
where the <i>hük</i> was narrow and leaped their horses to
the other side. While they were jumping, Ai threw a
heavy stone he had brought with him on to the bridge,
and the <i>hpea</i>, who fortunately was near-sighted, thinking
it was the tread of the horses, broke it down, so
that fell into the water fifty feet below, but the king
and his follower were safe on the other side.</p>

<p>The next danger was the city gate. They walked
their ponies slowly as though they were very tired, till
they came to within a cubit of the gate, and then galloped
through at the top of their speed, and crash went
the gateway behind them. They were covered with
dust but not hurt.</p>

<p>The king was very thankful to have arrived at his
palace and being very thirsty with the journey and excitement,
as the cunning <i>hpea</i> had expected, called for
a drink of water, but ere he could place the cup to his
lips his faithful follower turned it upside down, and
instead of water, out fell a cupful of sharp needles, and
again the king's life was saved.</p>

<p>Worn out with his ride he told his servants to pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>pare
his room as he would sleep. Ai called the chief
guard and told him to have a lamp burning all night,
to take his sharpest sword with him, and guard the
king carefully. In the middle of the night when the
tired king was sleeping soundly, into the room came
creeping slowly, slowly, the biggest rat ever seen. It
had long, sharp teeth and wicked glaring eyes, and made
toward the king. But the guard, warned by Ai, was
on the watch, and just as the rat was about to spring
at the king's throat, the soldier with a sweep of his
long, sharp sword cut off its head, and thus the king
through the cleverness of one man escaped the last
danger and could now live without fear.</p>

<p>The next morning the king called his heralds and
bade them go into the city and summon Sau Boo to
come to the palace to be rewarded. They searched
and called, but searched and called in vain. No man
ever heard of a man by that name, and the king was
fast getting angry when the <i>amats</i> told him that they
personally had gone to every house except one, and
that was the house of Ai. The king in surprise ordered
them to call his son-in-law. "He may be able to tell
us something about him," he observed. Ai accordingly
obeyed his summons, but the king was more surprised
yet when Ai told him that Sau Boo and himself were
one and the same, and that it was he who had rescued
the king from so many dangers.</p>

<p>At first his father-in-law became angry and refused
to believe him, but Ai gave an account of everything
that had happened from the time when the deer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
broke cover, till the rat was killed by the guard, and
thus convinced the king of his truthfulness.</p>

<p>The king then made a great feast, called all his ministers
and generals together, and made a proclamation
that Ai in future should be his <i>amat löng</i> and should
be king when he himself died.</p>

<p>Thus did the princess prove that her luck really depended
upon herself, and not on the king, and to-day
we say, "May your luck be as good as the luck of
Nang Kam Ung."</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="HOW_THE_HARE_DECEIVED_THE_TIGER" id="HOW_THE_HARE_DECEIVED_THE_TIGER"></a>HOW THE HARE DECEIVED THE TIGER.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="upper">t</span> the beginning of the world a hare, tiger, ox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
buffalo, and horse became friends and lived together.
One day the tiger was out hunting when, it
being in the middle of the hot season, the jungle caught
fire, and a strong wind blowing, it was not long before
the whole country was in flames. The tiger fled, but
the fire followed. Never mind how fast he ran, the
flames followed him, till he was in great fear of being
burned alive. As he was rushing along he saw the ox
feeding on the other side of the river and called out
to him:</p>

<p>"O friend ox, you see the fire is following me wherever
I go. Where is a place of refuge that I can escape
the fire?"</p>

<p>Now close to the tiger was a jungle full of dried
grass, such as the Shans use for thatching their houses,
and the ox replied, "Go to the grass jungle yonder, my
brother, and you will be safe."</p>

<p>But dried grass is the most inflammable thing in the
whole hill and water country, and so here, not only did
the flames follow the tiger, but they ran ahead of him
and threatened to engulf him on every side. In great
anger he roared at the ox, "False deceiver, if ever I
escape from this danger, I will return and kill you,"
but the ox only laughed at him and continued eating.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>In desperation, the tiger leaped over the flames and
found himself near the horse. "O friend horse," he
cried, "where can I go? I am in great danger of being
burned to death."</p>

<p>Now it happened that once the tiger had been very
rude to the horse and called him many bad names, so
now he thought this was a good opportunity to be revenged;
so he said: "Yonder is a big bamboo jungle,
run to that and you are safe"; but the tiger found that
the horse was also a false friend, for the fire following
him speedily ignited the tall bamboos which burned
fiercely and falling from above, almost completely covered
the poor beast.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the world the tiger was a beautiful
yellow color, but the bamboos falling all over him,
burnt him in stripes, and since that time his descendants
have had long black stripes all over their coats.</p>

<p>"When I have escaped from this," yelled the angry
tiger, "I will come back and kill you."</p>

<p>"Very good," sneered the horse, "and I will arch
my neck so that you can get a good bite," but this was
said to deceive the tiger, as the horse intended to lash
out with his hind feet when the tiger came to fight him.
Nevertheless, from that day the necks of all horses have
been arched, and they cannot fight an enemy in front,
but are obliged to arch their necks, lower their heads,
and kick from behind.</p>

<p>The tiger, by this time tired to death and suffering
from the burns of the bamboos, saw the buffalo and
accosted him as he had his other friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"O good friend buffalo," he cried, "I am in great
danger of being burned alive. The horse and the ox
have not only deceived me, but in following their advice
I have arrived at a worse condition than before. What
can I do to be freed from this great danger?"</p>

<p>The buffalo looked up from the cool river where he
was enjoying a bath, and taking compassion on him
said: "If you will catch hold of my throat I will duck
you in the river and so you shall escape from the
danger that is following you."</p>

<p>So the tiger seized the good buffalo by the throat and
was held under water till the fire had burnt itself out.
The tiger was very grateful to the buffalo and made an
agreement with him that from that time no tiger should
ever kill a buffalo, and it is only the very worst tigers,
those that kill men, that ever kill a buffalo, and the
tigers that are guilty of killing buffaloes are sure to be
killed themselves, sooner or later.</p>

<p>The tiger held so fast to the buffalo that when the
latter came out of the water, his throat and neck were
all white, and buffaloes all have that mark on their
necks and throats till this very day.</p>

<p>The tiger was so cold after his bath that he shook and
shivered as though he had fever, and seeing a little
house made of dried grass a short distance off he went
to it and found that a hare was living there.</p>

<p>"Good friend," said the tiger, "I am so cold I am
afraid I shall die. Will you take compassion on me
and allow me to rest in your house and get warm before
I return home?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in, our lord," said the hare. "If our lord
deigns to honor my poor house with his presence, he
will confer a favor that his slave will never forget."</p>

<p>The tiger was only too glad to go into the hare's
house, and the latter immediately made room for him
by sitting on the roof. Soon the tiger heard click!
click! click! and he called out: "O friend hare, what
are you doing up there on the roof of your house?"</p>

<p>Now the hare was really at that moment striking fire
with her flint and steel, but she deceived the tiger and
said, "It is very cold up here, and our lord's slave was
shivering," but the next moment the spark struck the
dried grass on the roof and the house was soon in
flames.</p>

<p>The tiger dashed out just in time and turned in a
rage on his late host, but the hare was far away, having
jumped at the same moment that the spark set fire
to the roof of the house.</p>

<p>The tiger gave chase, but after a while he saw the
hare sitting down and watching something intently, so
he asked, "What are you looking at?"</p>

<p>"This is a fine seat belonging to the Ruler of the
Hares," returned she.</p>

<p>"I would like to sit on it," said the tiger.</p>

<p>"Well," said the hare, "wait till I can go and ask
our lord to give you permission."</p>

<p>"All right, I will watch till you come back and will
not kill you as I intended doing, if you get me permission
to sit on it," said the tiger.</p>

<p>Now this was not a chair at all, but some hard sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stones that the hare had covered with mud and shaped
with her paws to deceive the tiger. The hare ran off a
long distance and pretended to talk with some one and
then called out: "The lord of the chair says, our lord
the tiger may sit, if he throws himself down upon it
with all his might. This is our custom."</p>

<p>The tiger flung himself upon what he thought was the
chair with all his might, but the soft mud gave way
and he fell upon the stones underneath and hurt his
paws badly. He therefore sprang up and vowed vengeance
on the hare that he could just see far off in the
distance.</p>

<p>By and by as the hare was running along she saw a
large wasps' nest hanging from the branch of a tree, so
she sat down and watched it intently. When the tiger
came up he was so curious to know what the hare was
looking at so intently that he did not kill her, but instead
asked her what she was looking at.</p>

<p>The hare showed the tiger the wasps' nest on the tree
and said: "That is the finest gong in all the hill and
water country."</p>

<p>"I would like to beat it," said the tiger.</p>

<p>"Just wait a minute," returned the hare, "and I
will go to the lord of the gong and ask permission for
you to beat it."</p>

<p>The hare ran till she was far away in the jungle, and
then at the top of her voice called out: "If you wish to
beat the gong, the lord of the gong says you must strike
it as hard as you can with your head. That is his
custom."</p>

</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The tiger butted at the nest with all his might and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
made a big jagged rent in its side, and out flew the
angry wasps in swarms, completely covering the poor
tiger, who with a dreadful yell of pain tore away from
his tormentors. His face was all swollen, and from that
day till the present, the faces of tigers have all been
wide and flat.</p>

<p>Again he chased the hare, and when the smart from
the stings of the wasps had subsided a little, he found
to his great joy that he was gaining on his enemy fast.
The hare on her part saw that the tiger would soon
catch her and looked around for some means of escape,
and spied just before her a snake half in and half out
of its hole.</p>

<p>The hare stopped as before and sat gazing at the
snake so intently that the tiger instead of killing her as
he had intended to do, asked her what it was in the
hole.</p>

<p>"This," returned the hare, "is a wonderful flute
that only kings and nobles are allowed to play. Would
our lord like to play?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I would," said the tiger; "but where is the
lord of this wonderful flute? Whom shall I ask for
permission?"</p>

<p>"If our lord watches right here," said the cunning
hare, "his slave will go to the lord of the flute and
ask permission," and the tiger, well content, sat down
to wait.</p>

<p>Again the cunning hare deceived the tiger by pretending
to ask permission, and when a long distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
off he called as before: "Our lord has permission to
play the flute. Let him put it in his mouth and blow
with all his might. This is the custom of the lord
of the flute."</p>

<p>The foolish tiger immediately took the snake's head
into his mouth, but the sound that followed came from
the tiger, not from the flute, and a terrible yell he gave
as the snake bit his mouth! But the hare was far
away and would soon have been safe but for an unlooked
for accident that nearly ended her life.</p>

<p>The people who lived in that part of the hill and
water country were at war with the State that joined
them on the north, and thinking that the soldiers of the
enemy would soon invade their country they had made
a trap in the middle of the path over which the hare
was running. First they dug a hole so deep that
should anybody fall in, it would be impossible to climb
out again. The sides of the pit were dug on the slant
so that the opening was smaller than the bottom. Over
the top they had placed thin strips of bamboo that would
break if any extra weight came upon them and they
had covered the whole with grass and leaves so that no
traveler would know that a trap was there. Into this
hole fell the poor little hare.</p>

<p>Presently the tiger came up to see where the hare had
gone, and when he saw the hole in the middle of the
path, he called out, "Where are you, friend hare?"
and the hare from the bottom of the trap called out,
"I have fallen into a trap."</p>

<p>Then the tiger sat on the ground and just bent double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
with laughter to think that at last he had the hare in
his power, but the little animal down in the hole
although she did not say anything, thought harder in
a few minutes than the tiger had in all his life. By and
by as she looked up through the hole she had made in
the roof, she saw that the sky overhead was getting
darker and darker as a storm was coming on, so in great
glee, although she pretended to be very much frightened,
she called out as loudly as ever she could:</p>

<p>"Our lord tiger! our lord tiger!"</p>

<p>At first the tiger did not answer, so the hare then
called, "Does not our lord see the great danger approaching?
Let our lord look at the sky."</p>

<p>The tiger looked up and saw the dark clouds coming
slowly, slowly on, covering the whole sky; his laughter
stopped and he soon began to get very frightened.</p>

<p>After a while, when it had become still darker, he
called to the hare: "O friend, what is the matter with
the sky? What is going to happen?"</p>

<p>Then the hare replied: "Our lord, the sky has fallen
where you see it is dark; that is far away, but in a few
minutes it will fall here and everybody will be crushed
to death."</p>

<p>The foolish tiger was now frightened half to death
and called to the hare: "O friend, I have treated you
badly in trying to kill you. Do not be angry and take
revenge on me, but take compassion on my terrible condition,
and graciously tell me how to escape this danger,
and I swear that I will never try to harm you more."</p>

<p>It was the hare's turn to laugh now, but she only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
laughed quietly to herself, for she was afraid the tiger
would hear her, then she said, "Down here our lord's
slave is quite safe. If our lord descends, he too will be
safe," and before the hare had hardly finished, the
cowardly tiger made a jump for the hole the hare had
made and joined her at the bottom of the trap.</p>

<p>But the hare was not out yet and she began to plan
how she could get out herself and yet keep the tiger in.
At last a happy thought struck her. She sidled up to
the tiger and began to tickle him in the ribs. The tiger
squirmed and twisted first one way and then the other,
first to one side and then to the other; at last he could
stand it no longer and catching the hare he threw her
out of the trap and she landed on solid ground.</p>

<p>As soon as the hare found she was safe, she began to
call at the top of her voice: "O men, come! come! I,
the hare have deceived the tiger and he is at the bottom
of the trap. O men, come! I, the hare call you.
Bring your spears and guns; bring your swords, and
kill the tiger that I have tricked into entering the trap."</p>

<p>At first the men did not believe the hare, for they did
not think that an animal so small as the hare could deceive
the tiger, but then they also knew that the hare
was very clever and had much wisdom, so they brought
their spears and their guns, their swords and their
sticks, and killed the tiger in the trap.</p>

<p>Thus did the hare prove that though small she was
full of wisdom, and although the tiger was bigger,
stronger, and fiercer than she, yet she, through her
wisdom, was able to kill him.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_TORTOISE" id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_TORTOISE"></a>THE STORY OF THE TORTOISE.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">here</span> was once a man who had two wives. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
as everybody knows it is always the chief wife that
the husband loves best, while the other instead of being
<i>Mae Long</i>, is only <i>Mae Noi</i>, and this often causes jealousy
and trouble in the family. It was so in this case,
especially as the chief wife did not have a son to add
to her dignity. They each had a daughter, the name
of the chief wife's child was Nang Hsen Gaw, and that
of the other Nang E.</p>

<p>One day the husband of these women went to the
lake to fish. He caught a large number of shell fish
and put them on the shore for his wives to bring home.
The younger took her share of the load, but, being very
hungry, she ate them all. The mother of Nang Hsen
Gaw, however, was not greedy like the other woman,
and so she put all the fish that were left into her bag
and began to trudge slowly toward the house.</p>

<p>Now, the mother of Nang E was a witch, although
no one, of course, knew it. Being wicked enough to be
a witch, she did not hesitate at committing any other
crime, even the most dreadful, and she therefore made
up her mind that she would kill the mother of Nang
Hsen Gaw so that she could be the chief wife. She got
home much sooner than the other woman, as she had no
load to carry, and when she saw her husband he natu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>rally
asked her where the fish were. "Now," she
thought, "here's a good chance to get that woman out
of the way," so she told her husband that his other wife
was a <i>pör</i>, or witch, and she had taken all the fish away
from her. Now, witches are of course very much
dreaded, so when the poor woman came home with her
heavy load of fish, the villagers killed her with their
sticks, and she was changed into a tortoise in the lake.</p>

<p>And now at last the mother of Nang E was chief
wife, but do you think she was satisfied? Not a bit
of it. She heard that her rival was now a tortoise in
the lake, and she determined to kill her again.</p>

<p>Some time after this, as Nang Hsen Gaw was in the
jungle watching the cows that belonged to her father,
she walked along the edge of the lake and was very
much surprised to hear her own name called in familiar
tones. She looked around, but could see no one, and
she was getting very frightened, thinking that it was
perhaps a <i>hpea</i> who wanted to entice her into the thick
jungle so that he could devour her, but at last she
looked on the ground at her feet and saw it was a tortoise
that was speaking to her.</p>

<p>"Nang Hsen Gaw," it called. "My daughter, <i>oie!</i>
I am your mother who was killed through the wicked
acts of my rival, the mother of Nang E. I have arrived
at great trouble, and now, instead of being the chief
wife of a rich man, I am nothing but a tortoise swimming
in the lake. Take pity on me, my daughter, and
out of compassion every day bring me cotton thread and
raw cotton, so that I can weave and spin."</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Nang Hsen Gaw was a dutiful daughter, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
day when she went to the jungle she took cotton for her
mother to spin, and thread for her to weave, and daily
talked with her, telling her all the gossip of the village
and anything else that she thought her mother would
like to hear.</p>

<p>But the mother of Nang E was on the watch, and
thinking it strange that the girl should take cotton and
thread to the jungle every day, and bring none back
with her when she drove the cattle back at night, she
followed her, heard her talking with her mother, and
thus found out in what part of the lake her enemy was,
and laid her plan accordingly.</p>

<p>That evening, unknown to her family, while her
husband was busy working in his garden, she went to
the house where lived the doctor of the village, unfolded
her plans to him and asked for his help. Being an unscrupulous
man he agreed, took the silver the woman
had pilfered from her husband, and promised to help
her. The next day she was taken very sick and her
husband called in the doctor, who told him that the
woman must have a tortoise from the lake near-by. If
she boiled and ate it according to his directions she
would get well, if not, she would die. Having performed
his part of the bargain he returned to his home
at the other end of the village.</p>

<p>Next morning the man went to the lake to get the
tortoise. Nang Hsen Gaw was much distressed when
she saw her father set out, and her distress became
worse when she saw that the wicked stepmother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
directed him to the little pond where her own mother
was. The man took a large bucket made out of wicker
work, and commenced baling out the water, but Nang
Hsen Gaw was able to warn her mother just where her
father was, so that when he was on one side of the
pond her mother went to the other, but at last he sent
the girl home, and in a few minutes secured the tortoise
and was soon carrying it away for his wife to eat.</p>

<p>When he got home he gave her the tortoise, little
thinking who it was, and then went out, while the
witch called Nang Hsen Gaw to watch the pot which
had been put over the fire.</p>

<p>Soon the poor girl heard her mother call out. She
said that the hot water had reached her knees, and
begged her to put out the fire. She commenced to rake
out the hot embers from under the pot, when her stepmother
saw what she was doing, and taking up a heavy
bamboo beat her unmercifully and made her put more
sticks on the fire. Soon her mother complained again that
the heat had reached her shoulders, and again Nang
E's mother beat her, and made her put more sticks on
the fire. Soon she heard her mother say: "My
daughter, <i>oie</i>! The hot water has reached my neck
and I shall soon be dead. When it is all over, do not
let that wicked woman destroy me altogether, but bury
me in the jungle," and in a few minutes she was dead.</p>

<p>Nang Hsen Gaw tried her best to get the dead body
of her mother, but her stepmother watched her carefully,
and all she could not eat herself she gave to the
dogs, to prevent her daughter from getting any, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
one dog ran off with his portion into the jungle. Nang
Hsen Gaw followed in time to rescue the webbing
between the fingers.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This was all that was left, but
she buried that carefully in the jungle far from the
house where her stepmother lived.</p>

<p>The next day as she was walking through the jungle
feeding her cows, she heard sweet music. It sounded like
twelve organs all playing at the same time, and yet in
harmony, each organ blending with the others. In great
surprise she hunted around till she came to the spot
where she had buried the part of her mother's hand,
and saw that during the night this had changed into a
beautiful <i>mai nyung kham</i> tree.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And so this good and
dutiful daughter went every day to listen to the tree as
she had gone daily to the lake when her mother had
been a tortoise, and the tree sang sweeter when she was
near than at any other time.</p>

<p>But such a wonderful thing as this could not be kept
a secret. Others heard of it and people came from far
and near to hear the sweet music come from the tree.
One of the <i>amats</i> of the great king who "ate"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the
country, heard that a miracle was to be seen in this
jungle, and accordingly reported it to his lord, who sent
men to cut the tree down and bring it to his palace. All
day long the men worked at the tree, from the time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>country became light till the moon rose at night, but
although they had the sharpest of axes and were the
most skillful workmen in all the country, yet with all
their labor they could only cut through the bark, and
during the night the tree grew so quickly that when
the morning dawned, it was twice as large as it was the
night before, and the marks made by the axes on the
bark were covered with new bark harder than ever.</p>

<p>The king was very angry when he heard of the ill
success of his woodmen, had them all executed, and
sent others, but they had no better success than the
first. But this only made the king more stubborn and
determined to get the tree at any cost, and he therefore
sent the heralds all through the country and made a
proclamation that any man who could bring the tree to
his palace should be made his <i>Kem Möng,</i> that is, heir
apparent; should it be a woman, she should become
<i>Nang Me Prah</i>, or chief queen. Many men therefore
came with sharp <i>pahs</i> and axes but all were equally unsuccessful,
and the king despaired of ever getting the
tree, when Nang Hsen Gaw heard of the reward offered
by the king, and told the heralds she could bring the
tree to his palace. The king was full of joy when he
heard this, and made great preparations for her. On
her part she simply went to the jungle and, taking
off her turban, fastened it around the tree and carried
it bodily into the palace where it sang as sweetly every
day as when it was in the jungle.</p>

<p>When the mother of Nang E heard of the good
fortune that had befallen Nang Hsen Gaw she was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
angry, and calling her own daughter to follow her, she
set off for the capital. When she had arrived there she
disguised herself and became a servant to the queen,
and pondered how she could kill the <i>Nang Me Prah</i> and
put her own daughter Nang E in her place.</p>

<p>One day this wicked woman told the queen that she
had found some fine soap beans and bark, that she was
very skillful in shampooing, and as the next day was to
be a great feast when the queen would follow the king
on her royal elephant, the soap beans would make her
black hair blacker, and the gloss glossier than ever,
and asked her to allow her to wash the queen's head at
a well that was just outside the gate of the palace, near
the royal gardens, where the water was very sweet.
The queen consented and called her attendants to follow,
but the stepmother was much too cunning to allow
that, so she told the queen that her method of washing
was better than any other woman's but it was a secret,
and she would reserve it for her majesty's own private
use, but she did not want any of the attendants to see
how it was done. If they did, she added, the next day
at the feast every lady in the court would have hair as
glossy as the queen's, but if they went alone, her hair
would be as much more beautiful than any other
woman's as the sun is more beautiful than the bamboo
torch that lights the way through the jungle at night,
when there is no moon. The young queen was not
proof against this flattery, and so the two women went
alone out of the palace, the very guards who watched
at the gates not knowing whither they were going.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>They soon arrived at the well, and as the queen was
bending over, her long hair covering her face so that
she could see nothing, her wicked stepmother suddenly
drew a knife and stabbed her to the heart, then, calling
her daughter to help, she buried the poor young queen
under the road leading to the well. She took the royal
robes and put them on her own daughter, Nang E, who
returned to the royal palace and entered the royal
apartments, all the attendants thinking it was the real
queen returned from a bath in the river.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, as the king walked through
the palace, he was surprised to see that the wonderful
singing tree was all withered and mute. In great distress
he called for the queen and ordered her to make
the tree sing as before, but although Nang E tried with
all her might, she could make no sound. She tapped
it softly as she had seen Nang Hsen Gaw do, but all in
vain. It was silent.</p>

<p>Now the king was in the habit of wearing Burmese
clothing instead of Shan, and one day when he had
gone to his room to put on his <i>ptsoe</i>, he found that a
little sparrow had built, her nest in it. He was a very
kind man, and so allowed the little bird to live there,
and in gratitude to the king this sparrow was in the
habit of telling him all she saw as she flew around the
city from morn to night, and whenever the king wished
to find out anything that puzzled him, he would often
call the sparrow to tell him what to do.</p>

<p>He therefore now called the little bird and asked it
what ailed the tree, and the sparrow told him that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
woman who was then in the royal apartments and wearing
the clothes of the <i>Nang Me Prah</i> was not the real
queen, but a woman named Nang E, and seeing her
approach, the brave little bird began whistling, "This
is not the <i>Nang Me Prah</i>, this is Nang E, Nang E.
Oh! Nang E!"</p>

<p>In a great rage the king commanded his servants to
call the woman, and when she was come into the royal
presence she dared not open her mouth to answer the
king, for she was not so clever as her mother, who
could disguise her voice as well as her face, and she
knew that if she began to speak the king would see
that she was not Nang Hsen Gaw, so she remained silent.
But this did not save her, for the king looked at
her and said:</p>

<p>"You wear the robes and jewels of my queen, but
you have not the same face, and you are afraid to speak
to me," and he immediately called his chief executioner
to take her away and cut off her head.</p>

<p>But even this did not bring back the music to the
tree, and the king was disconsolate.</p>

<p>The next morning when the guard of the royal garden
went to his post, he saw, near the well, a beautiful
<i>mawk moo</i> flower, took it home with him and placed it
in the <i>chattie</i> of water that every Shan keeps in his
house as an offering to the <i>hpeas</i>. The old mother Nai,
soon after took her basket and went to the bazaar to
buy <i>puc</i> for her son's breakfast, but when she returned
she was surprised to see that during her absence some
one had swept the house, cooked the food, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
"morning rice" was all ready to eat. The eating-tray
was set out in the middle of the room. The rice and
curry was arranged in order on it, and the drinking
<i>chattie</i> was full of scented water. She called her son
and all the neighbors to ask who had done this, but no
one could tell her, and in great amazement they sat
down to their meal. That evening the same thing happened
again. While she was out, the house was again
swept, the food was prepared, and the tray arranged
as in the morning. For several days this happened,
and then the old woman determined to hide and see
who did these kind acts. She did so, and was amazed
to see that as soon as she had left the house (she went
under the floor and looked up through a hole between
the bamboos), that a spirit came out of the <i>mawk moo</i>
flower that her son had brought from the road leading
to the well, and commenced to sweep the house. In the
midst of it the old woman rushed up to the flower and
destroyed it, so that the spirit could not go back to its
refuge. At the same instant, it changed into the most
beautiful woman ever seen.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Nang Hsen Gaw, for the spirit was
she, told old Nai how her stepmother had killed her
at the well, and buried her, and how she had been
changed into the spirit of the beautiful <i>mawk moo</i> flower
the guard had brought to the house, and that she would
soon go back to the king in the palace.</p>

<p>They neither of them had seen the little sparrow sitting
on the roof, but she had been there all the time,
and now flew off to the king and told him all that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
had heard. The king gave orders that the wicked
mother of Nang E should be executed immediately,
and that a band of soldiers should go to the guard's
house to escort his bride back in state to the palace,
where she reigned many, many years, till she saw her
grandchildren and great-grandchildren grow up. As
soon as the queen entered the gate, the tree began to
play; the withered leaves put on a bright hue, and
beautiful flowers burst into bloom; and while Nang
Hsen Gaw lived, the tree bloomed and played sweetest
music every day.</p>

<p>The lessons that this story teaches are: As surely
as the wheels of the cart follow the oxen, so surely will
wickedness be punished. If you sin you must suffer.
The man who kills another will assuredly meet the
same fate.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="THE_SPARROWS_WONDERFUL_BROOD" id="THE_SPARROWS_WONDERFUL_BROOD"></a>THE SPARROW'S WONDERFUL BROOD.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="upper">any,</span> many years ago, at the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
world, a little sparrow built her nest on the top
of a tall tree that grew near the edge of a lake. In it
she laid five little eggs, and never was mother bird
prouder than she, and all day long she flew from tree
to tree chirping out her joy. So proud in fact was she,
and so much noise did she make, that a monkey that
lived on the other side of the lake was struck with the
remembrance of how he had once dined with great satisfaction
on eggs laid by the sparrow's sister, and in a
few minutes he was on his way to repeat the performance.</p>

<p>In vain the little bird cried and begged him to spare
her brood, promising to show him where the sweetest
plantains in all the country were growing; the monkey
only laughed at her and climbed the tree to get the
prize.</p>

<p>The next moment the robber would have gotten his
spoil, and this wonderful story would never have been
told, but just then the great lord Sa Kyah looked
earthward and saw the tragedy that was taking place.</p>

<p>Like a drop of rain that falls from a tree when the
wind blows after a shower, the mighty lord descended,
and when the would-be robber reached the nest his
hand entered an empty one.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 596px; height: 343px;">
<a name="i079" id="i079"></a><img src="images/i079.jpg" width="596" height="343" alt="&quot;On his way he saw what seemed to be a bed of flowers.&quot; Page 79." title="" />
<span class="captionl">&quot;On his way he saw what seemed to be a bed of flowers.&quot;</span> <span class="captionr">Page 79.</span>
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The eggs were soon brought back from the <i>hpea</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
country where the lord Sa Kyah had taken them for
safety, and in due time were hatched. Out of the first
protruded a sharp bill, and a kingfisher, bright of
plumage and swift of wing, broke out of its speckled
prison. The next egg broke and a buffalo came out, to
be followed by a lordly striped tiger from the next. A
terrible <i>hpea-loo</i>, with head and claws like a bird and
body like a man, tore his way out of the next one,
already looking around for a man whom he might devour
for his first meal.</p>

<p>Only one egg remained, and that the smallest of all,
but out of it came a man, and the mighty lord Sa
Kyah smiled when he saw him, and said that although
he was the smallest and the last, yet he must feed his
brothers and take care of them.</p>

<p>One hot day in summer the buffalo that had come out
of one of the eggs, walking through the jungle, much
troubled by mosquitoes, thought how nice would be a
wallow in a hole well known to him under the shade of
the trees by the bank of the lake, where the sun had
not dried the mud to the hardness of bricks as it had
in every other wallow, and accordingly turned his huge
body in its direction, and slowly set off toward it.</p>

<p>On his way there he saw on the ground what appeared
to him to be a bed of flowers growing on the
bank of the lake, and after smelling it carefully over,
leisurely ate it all up.</p>

<p>The sun was hot, the earth dry, and the flowers had
long ago died, and what the buffalo thought were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
flowers were really ten white jackets and ten red skirts.
But when he had finished his meal he continued his
journey to the wallow, and then with a grunt expressive
of great satisfaction, sinking into the soft mud till only
the tips of his horns and the top of his head were visible,
he closed his eyes and enjoyed himself.</p>

<p>By and by there was a great commotion in the water&mdash;shouts,
laughter, and jokes, together with a great
splashing. The lazy buffalo opened one eye and saw
ten young girls who were having great fun in the cool
water, throwing it over one another and chasing each
other here and there. When they came to the place
where they had left their clothes, however, their mirth
received a sudden check. They had all disappeared!
They stood up to their armpits in the water looking at
each other with very long faces till, spying the buffalo
in his mud bath, they approached him, and in the most
courteous language asked him whether he had seen their
dresses.</p>

<p>The great beast closed the eye he had opened, and
slowly uncovered the other one, but beyond this took
no notice of the maids forlorn. Then, calling him
"Kind Brother Buffalo," they begged him to answer
them, saying that all the people who left the village to
go to the bazaar before the sun had risen would soon
be passing on their way home. The buffalo blew a big
cloud of mud and water from his nostrils, but said
never a word.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the youngest of the sparrow's
brood, the man, was in the jungle all the time. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
had seen his brother eat up all the clothes and had
heard all the conversation. He had noticed too, that
although all the maidens were beautiful, the youngest
was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He saw
how straight was her form, how black was her hair, and
that her eyes were the color of the sky when there are
many stars but no moon, and he determined to get her
for his wife. He therefore now approached the party
and told them that he could help them, and that no
one besides could tell them where their clothes were,
but that they must promise that the one whom he
should pick out should be his wife.</p>

<p>To this they agreed, and thus it happened that he
became possessed of the most beautiful woman in all
the Shan country. So beautiful in fact was she, that
it is said the birds stopped in the middle of a song
when they saw her. The squirrels stopped half-way
up the tree in their search for nuts as she walked under
the trees, and her fame spread far and wide.</p>

<p>At this time a hunter came wandering through the
jungle in search of game, and saw her standing at her
door. He, like everybody else, was struck with her
wonderful beauty, and he thought to himself, "For a
long time I have been most unfortunate. I have caught
but few animals, and their furs have been poor and
mangy. Now, if I tell the king of my country about
this beautiful girl, he will give me a great reward."</p>

<p>Thus reasoning he set out home and told the king
what he had seen, enlarging upon her great beauty till
the king resolved to get her at any cost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>He therefore set out, taking with him soldiers and
attendants as became such a mighty lord, and when he
saw the object of his journey he acknowledged that the
hunter had not deceived him, and he determined to
take her back with him to the palace; but at the same
time he made up his mind to go about it in a cunning
way.</p>

<p>Now this king had a wonderful fighting cock of
which he was very proud, and which had never been
beaten. It had a beak of iron and spurs as sharp as
the knives that come from Lai Hka, and a voice so
loud and piercing that every morning when he crowed
every other rooster in the city scurried away in fright
at the challenge.</p>

<p>The king, therefore, said that he and the woman's
husband should have a cock fight. He would wager
his country against the other's wife. In great sorrow
the man went out into the jungle to think over his misfortune,
and while sitting on the ground in a most disconsolate
manner he heard a little bird calling his name,
and looking up he saw his brother, the kingfisher,
perched above him.</p>

<p>"O brother, do not fear," said the bright little bird.
"I do not forget that you are my brother and have
guarded me long, and now I will surely help you in
your trouble."</p>

<p>When the time came for the fight, therefore, and the
king's fighting cock stood proudly up, suddenly down
from a tree flew the kingfisher, pecked him with his
long, sharp bill, and then flew away before he could so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
much as turn his head. Time and again this happened
till the king's challenger finally stretched himself dead
on the ground.</p>

<p>The fight ending in this way, however, did not suit
the selfish king a bit, and he therefore said it was not
a fair fight, and brought out a large, fierce dog. This
dog was the terror of the State, but the king said that
it should fight any other dog that could be brought
against it for the same stakes as before. The tiger
brother, however, was on the watch, and before the
dog could get near his opponent, a blow from his paw
ended his career.</p>

<p>Still the king persisted in his unjust course, and now
declared that the wager should be finally settled by a
fight between two buffaloes. Now the buffalo brother
was ashamed of the way in which he had treated the
girls in the water, and had long wished for an opportunity
to retrieve his honor, so that he now fought with
such bravery against the royal buffalo that he speedily
conquered it.</p>

<p>Then the king, seeing that he was beaten every time,
threw off all disguise and said plainly that he had come
to get the girl for his wife, had brought soldiers to help
him if necessary, and he would take her in spite of
losing the different battles, and in spite of her husband
or anybody else.</p>

<p>He stepped forward to take her, but he did not
know that one more brother yet remained to be heard
from, for out of the jungle with a dreadful yell came
rushing the <i>hpea-loo</i>, his beak open, his claws out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>stretched,
and king, soldiers, and courtiers all disappeared
down his ravenous maw.</p>

<p>The next month the fortunate man with his beautiful
wife became king in the place of his enemy, and lived
to be the oldest monarch in the whole of the Shan
country.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="HOW_THE_WORLD_WAS_CREATED" id="HOW_THE_WORLD_WAS_CREATED"></a>HOW THE WORLD WAS CREATED.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="upper">n</span> the beginning of the world, many, many cycles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
ago, so long ago, in fact, that no man knows how
long it was, there were no trees, no hills, no land,
nothing but water. The wind blew the waters hither
and thither, sometimes in great waves, sometimes in
quiet ripples; the wind blew, the waves rolled, and that
was all.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Gong Gow, the Great Spirit
Spider, felt weary with carrying around her heavy burden
of eggs wrapped up so carefully in their white
covering fastened to her waist, therefore she said to
herself:</p>

<p>"I would fain place my eggs in a safe place, but
know of none where they can hatch themselves without
danger," so she searched through the universe to find
a suitable place, and at last she spied the water that
is now the world, and in it began to spin her web.</p>

<p>Backward and forward, forward and backward, round
and round, in and out she wove, till at last all was
done, and full of content she left her eggs in their web
prison nest and journeyed away.</p>

<p>The wind blew and drove the water hither and
thither as aforetime, and soon little pieces of solid substance
caught in the meshes of the web, and behold!
as the time passed the solid substance became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
solid till it formed mud and separated itself from the
water, and when the mud had dried, lo! it was the
earth.</p>

<p>So the eggs of the great Spirit Spider were safely
locked up within the earth; by and by they hatched,
and breaking forth there appeared the first man, Boo
Pau, and the first woman, Myeh Pau, from whom all
the ancient people who belonged to the first race were
descended.</p>

<p>Many, many years passed and people lived out their
lives, till one day the great earth caught fire. It
burned fiercer than anybody's imagination can conceive,
and it destroyed everything. All the beautiful
forests with their green coverings of moss and leaves,
all the cities which the first race had builded were
burned down, till by and by there was naught more
for the fire to consume, and it was then the end of the
hot season; the time of wet came soon after, and the
rain fell upon the burning earth in such torrents that
the whole sky was covered with the steam.</p>

<p>Now it happened that in Möng Hpea, the far-away
land where dwell the powerful spirits whom we call
"hsangs," the smell of the steam ascended and ascended
till all the spirits smelled the sweet scent, and
said to themselves:</p>

<p>"Behold, there appears a sweet smell arising from
below, what can it be?" and there was much marveling
at what could cause such sweet-smelling incense
as that then ascending.</p>

<p>And it also happened that in Möng Hpea were nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
spirits, five of them males and four females, and these
being of more adventurous spirit than their fellows, determined
to find out for themselves where the sweet
perfume came from. So they set out on their travels
downward. They descended faster and faster, and the
faster they descended the sweeter became the smell, till
at last they landed upon this world of ours, and bending
down to the earth they tore great handfuls of it
out and ate it with the greatest relish.</p>

<p>It was morning time when they descended, and they
fed upon the fragrant earth all day till the sun set and
the shades of evening began to surround them, then
the eldest of the spirits looked around upon his fellows,
and said:</p>

<p>"Brethren, oie! it is time that we ascended to our
own country," and as the rest assented they stood up
to return, but alas! they could not rise, they had eaten
so much earth it had made them too heavy to soar, and
from that day to the day they died none of them ever
found their way back to the beautiful country of the
Hsangs, but had to spend all their lives upon this earth
of ours.</p>

<p>Thus we see that it is earthly desires that keep us
from the spirit country. We see, or we hear, we smell
or desire some earthly thing. We get our desires, but
they keep us pinned down to the earth. We cannot
go to the spirit country because of them.</p>

<p>When the spirits discovered that they could not return
to the Hsang country they agreed that they would
marry each other and take up their abode upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
earth of ours. But here arose a difficulty; there were
five male hsangs but only four females! There was
chance of a great quarrel, but the strongest of them,
his name was Hsin Kyan, thought within himself:</p>

<p>"I am stronger than any of my brothers and could
easily defeat them and marry whom I will, but what
merit would there be in that? I will ask them whether
they would be willing to make me king and each of
them give me of their daughters when they are old
enough, then in time I shall have wives and power as
well." Thus we see it is the man who is willing to
control his desires and wait who becomes great.</p>

<p>Hsin Kyan's brethren were very glad to make the
agreement and thus it was that he became the ruler of
them all. When the daughters of the others were old
enough, they brought them to the king, and from that
day it has been the custom for men to offer their daughters
to the king.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the universal lord, Sa Kyah,
who rules over all spirits and men looked earthward
and saw the new kingdom that was established; he became
jealous and determined to kill Hsin Kyan and
take his kingdom away from him. But Hsin Kyan
was very subtle and cunning, so he tattooed himself
with charms of such great strength that even the
mighty lord Sa Kyah could not kill him. For many
years they fought. Great mountains were thrown by
each combatant at the other, but Hsin Kyan could not
defeat the lord Sa Kyah, neither could the lord Sa
Kyah kill Hsin Kyan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Our great ancestor Hsin Kyan had seven daughters,
whose names to this day are remembered among us as
they have been given to the different days of the week,
from Nang Ta Nang Nooie, the eldest, after whom we
call the first day of the week Wan Ta Nang Nooie, to
Nang Hsa Ne, the youngest, and when the mighty
lord Sa Kyah found that he could not kill their father,
he spoke to these daughters and told them he was
searching for one whom he would make his chief queen,
and that if one of them would kill his enemy, their
father, and bring to him his head, he would choose
that one to be his queen and make her joint ruler of
the universe; with him she should govern everything
created.</p>

<p>But the charms tattooed upon Hsin Kyan were very
potent. Water would not drown him; fire would not
burn him; rope would not strangle him; and he was
invulnerable against thrust of spear and stroke of sword,
and although all seven of his daughters tried to kill
him yet they were not able to do so and six of them
gave up the attempt in despair.</p>

<p>One day, however, the youngest, she whom we worship
on the seventh day of the week and because she
was the smallest call it Wan Hsa Nae, was walking in
the jungle, and as she was passing under a tree she saw
a bird sitting upon its topmost branch. Now this girl
knew how clever birds are, and so she said to it:</p>

<p>"Brother Bird, oie! can you tell me how I can kill
my father?"</p>

<p>Now although this daughter was the youngest, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
she was more lovely than all her sisters, and the bird
was so pleased with her that he said:</p>

<p>"Nang Hsa Nae, you are so beautiful that I will
tell you the secret of your father's charm. Water cannot
drown him, fire cannot burn him, neither can sword
or spear wound him, but there is one way in which he
may be killed. Take you, seven strands of a spider's
web and twist them into a cord, then with a piece of
white bamboo make a bow; with this you will be able
to cut off the head of your father and take it to the
mighty lord Sa Kyah, and oh!" continued the clever
bird, "when you are his queen, do not forget the good
turn I have done you, and the debt of gratitude you
owe me therefor."</p>

<p>Nang Hsa Nae was full of joy when she learned
the secret of her father's charm and she promised
the little bird that when she became queen of the
universe she would grant him any desire that he craved.</p>

<p>That night when everybody else was asleep, Nang
Hsa Nae crept to her father's side and with the bow
made of the seven twisted strands of a spider's web
killed him and cut off his head.</p>

<p>With great joy she carried it to the universal lord.
He was very glad to find that his enemy was at last
dead, but although he had given his word to her, yet
he would not marry Nang Hsa Nae, for, said he, she
has killed her father although I could not conquer him.
Were I to marry her, who will go surety for her that
she will not do the same to me? So the wicked daughter
did not gain her ambitious end after all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only that, however, but she and her sisters received
a punishment, one they are even now suffering,
and will continue till the world ends. It is this:</p>

<p>When they found that the lord Sa Kyah would not
marry their youngest sister or even accept their father's
head, they said among themselves:</p>

<p>"What shall we do with the head of our father?
Where shall we bury it? Should we place it in the
earth the whole world would catch on fire; should we
throw it into the sea, all the seven oceans would immediately
boil; what shall we do?"</p>

<p>In their distress they went to the mighty lord Sa
Kyah and in humble tones begged his lordship to give
them advice so that they would be freed from the terrible
trouble to which their wickedness had brought
them. He looked at them and said:</p>

<p>"This is what you must do. You," pointing to the
youngest, "must carry your father's head in your
arms all this year, and when the year is finished you
can give it to the sister who is next older than yourself.
She will carry it for a year and thus one of you
will ever after bear it."</p>

<p>And so it is. We know when the year ends because
then come the Wan Kyap or washing days, when the
princess who has carried her father's head for a year
gives it to her elder sister and washes the bloodstains
from her clothes.</p>

<p>From these spirits all the inhabitants of the world
are descended, and so we see the saying of our philosophers
is true, "We have all descended from spirits."</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="HOW_THE_KING_OF_PAGAN_CAUGHT_THE" id="HOW_THE_KING_OF_PAGAN_CAUGHT_THE"></a>HOW THE KING OF PAGAN CAUGHT THE THIEF.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="upper">any,</span> many years ago there lived near the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
city of Pagan a famous robber chief who was so
fierce and cruel that he made all men fear his name.
He stole and killed and burned till the mothers used
to frighten their disobedient children by saying, "Boh
Lek Byah will get thee." He was a very brave and
clever thief, and he became so strong that the headmen
and elders of all the towns and villages throughout the
country were obliged to fee him with money and goods,
and if by any chance they did not pay this blackmail
immediately it was demanded, that very night the followers
of the robber chief would assuredly burn down
their village and kill every man, woman, and child
within it, for this was Shan and Burmese custom.</p>

<p>Boh Lek Byah entered every house in Pagan. None
was too big, none too small. He stole from the <i>whon's</i>
house as easily as from the hut of the poor man; it
made no difference to him, till at last the palace where
the great king lived was the only place whence he had
not gotten booty. Several of his followers were caught
and crucified, but that did not stop his bad actions or
frighten him. In the old days, when a robber was
caught he was taken to the jungle where the tigers are.
All the tigers knew the place of execution as well as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
dog knows worship days when the women offer rice and
curry at the pagodas. They used to tie the thieves fast
to the cross by their feet, hands, and hair, and when
they had jeered at them and the women and children
had pelted them with stones and beaten them with bamboos,
everybody went home and left them for the tigers
to eat, and thus they did to the followers of Maung
Lek Byah, but they could never catch the robber chief
himself.</p>

<p>At last the people of Pagan city came to the Amat
Löng, who was next in rank to the king himself, and
said:</p>

<p>"Our lord, for long thy slaves have been in great
and sore trouble, and unless our lord takes pity upon
his servants we shall all arrive at destruction."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" cried the <i>amat</i>, in a loud, angry
voice, "has he not stolen from me? Did I not pay
him two whole <i>ticcals</i> of pure silver as protection money
no later than the last Water Feast, and yet did he not
rob me as I was coming home in my boat yesternight,
and when I told him that I was the Amat Löng, did
he not laugh in my face and yet rob me just the same.
What can I do?"</p>

<p>"Our lord can go to the Ruler of the Golden Palace
and plead for his slaves," suggested one of the suppliants.</p>

<p>Now, the Amat Löng was a very cunning man, and
he knew that if the king heard that Boh Lek Byah
had stolen so much from his subjects he would be very
angry, and might perhaps even deprive him of his rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
as chief amat, for it was his duty to see that all robbers
were caught and punished, therefore after thinking
for a while, he said:</p>

<p>"My friends, listen to me; let us each give silver,
as much as we can afford; it is better to give part of
our possessions than to have everything taken from us.
Dost hear? This silver we will give to the <i>boh</i>, and
he will then not trouble us any more, but will go to
towns where the people are poorer and cannot afford to
give as much as we, the citizens of this royal city of
Pagan; then shall we have peace."</p>

<p>This advice was very good and would have been acted
upon, but unfortunately, one of the little princes happened
to be in the audience chamber that morning and
heard what had been said. He went to his father, the
ruler of the Golden Palace, and told the king what he
had heard; therefore his majesty called the <i>amat</i> to the
Golden Foot and asked him of these things.</p>

<p>"What is this I hear?" he demanded. "Has this
wicked man robbed as much as the people say? Why
hast thou not caught him as it was thy duty to do?"</p>

<p>"Son of the Sun," replied the servant, trembling
very much as he kneeled before him, for who would
not be afraid when the king is angry? "it is true;
but this thief is a very wicked and clever thief, besides
which he has a wonderful charm tattooed upon his
body which is so potent that it makes him invulnerable
to wounds from sword or gun, neither can he be bound
with ropes, therefore it hath been impossible for the
slave of our lord the king to capture or harm him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," said the king, still very angry, "get thee
a charm still more potent than the one the robber chief
hath, for if thou dost not bring him or his head to me
ere three days have elapsed, thou shalt fall from thy
rank of chief <i>amat</i>. Dost thou hear?"</p>

<p>The <i>amat</i> bowed till his head touched the floor before
the Golden Foot and he crawled away from the
presence the most unhappy man in all the king's possessions.
Then in great haste he ran to his house and
called all the charm-makers in the city to come to him
without delay. Then when they had assembled before
him he commanded them to make him a charm which
would be stronger than the one tattooed upon the body
of the robber chief, Boh Lek Byah. But the charm-sellers
one and all declared that this was an impossibility,
for the thief had upon the luckiest day of the whole
year eaten a piece of flesh cut from the body of a murdered
man, and so he could not be harmed in any way,
neither was it in their power to give his lordship the
amat a charm stronger than his.</p>

<p>Very frightened was the amat when he heard this,
and very frightened were the soldiers who had been
ordered to go with him and catch the thief. Their
wives also cried all that night, for they knew what a
terrible man the robber was, and how angry he would
be with the men who had dared come to capture him.
He would show no mercy, and without doubt would kill
them all, and in derision send their heads back to the
city afterward. This the robber had done before more
than once to parties of soldiers sent to take him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it happened that among the soldiers who followed
the Amat Löng was one who had a very wise and
clever wife, and when she saw her husband march away
and knew the great danger that he and his fellows were
in, she went to the wife of another soldier, and this is
what she said:</p>

<p>"Sister, oie, listen to my words. If we do naught
but sit in our houses and weep our husbands will all
assuredly arrive at destruction, for the <i>boh</i> is a very
cruel and cunning man. Of what use will our houses
be to us if we have no husbands? Listen, therefore,
to what I say. The man who collects the blackmail
for the <i>boh</i> from the headman of a village across the
river and delivers it into his hand is well known to me.
His name is Maung Gyei, and he sells books in the
bazaar. He is a very wise man, and knows all the followers
of the Boh Lek Byah. Let our husbands fight
the <i>boh</i> with silver. It is sharper than a sword, and
injures not the man who handles it skillfully. We will
collect all the money we can. I will sell my earrings,
thou canst sell thy bracelets, and the wives of all the
other soldiers can do likewise. This will bring a big bag
of silver, and half of it we will give to Maung Gyei.
He will then call some of the followers of the <i>boh</i> to a
secret place and tell him that the Amat Löng will give
him the balance in return for the head of their master,
if they take it to his lordship ere three days have
have elapsed. Our husbands will then bring the head
of this wicked man to the royal palace and lay it before
the Golden Foot; they will reap much honor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
glory for having fulfilled the order of the king and the
country will be freed from this great trouble."</p>

<p>Now, when the wives of the other soldiers heard
these words they perceived that she was indeed a very
clever woman, fit to be the wife of a great <i>amat</i> instead
of a common soldier, and one ran swiftly after the
<i>amat</i> and his men, for in truth they had not gone far,
but were traveling slowly, because they feared to come
up with the <i>boh</i> and his fierce followers; and they were
filled with joy at the good news the messenger brought
them. At the order of the <i>amat</i> his men hid themselves
in a thick jungle till the money should be collected
and brought to them.</p>

<p>After two days and when it was very dark, a man
came to them saying that he was the friend of Maung
Gyei, and bore with him the head of the robber chief,
and thereupon showed it wrapped up in a cloth. Then
were the soldiers full of joy again, and they paid the
money to him, and that night they slept peacefully, for
they knew that their enemy could harm them no more,
and that they had been delivered from the great danger
which had been threatening them. Before they
slept the <i>amat</i> sent a swift messenger to the city to tell
the king the good news that the robber chief was dead,
and that they were bearing his head with them and
would present it before the Golden Foot the next
morning.</p>

<p>Next day, therefore, at the head of his men, he
marched to the Golden Palace, and the people of the
city were so full of joy over the fact that Boh Lek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Byah was dead, that great numbers followed the procession
to the palace gates in the hopes of getting a
glimpse at the head of their enemy, and everybody
praised the Amat Löng for his bravery and wisdom in
killing the robber chief who had oppressed them so
sorely. His wife also called musicians and dancers, and
gave orders to her servants to prepare a great feast that
night in honor of her brave husband. They reached
the Golden Foot and knelt before the throne, but when
the basket was opened, behold, it contained the head
of another man, and not that of the <i>boh</i> at all.</p>

<p>Then did all the people in the city laugh at the <i>amat</i>
because his enemy had deceived him, and he fell from
his rank of chief <i>amat</i>. All his golden umbrellas were
taken away from him and given to his successor, and
he was obliged to earn his living by selling medicines
in bazaar, and from that day till he died he bore the
nickname of Amat Toak Arah;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but the people all
praised the cleverness of his enemy, the thief.</p>

<p>Now, when the king saw how cunning Boh Lek
Byah was and how easily he had deceived his servant,
he determined that he himself would take the robber
chief and thus gain great credit and renown. To this
end he gave orders to the headman of every village
throughout his kingdom that directly the robber should
come within his jurisdiction he was to report immediately,
and the king would send a trusty officer to arrest
him. He did not tell them that he himself would go,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>therefore for a long time the headmen feared to obey
the order of the king for, said they among themselves:
"The <i>boh</i> deceived the Amat Löng, who was one of the
most cunning of men, and will he not escape from any
other whom it should please our lord the king to send
against him? Is there any more cunning man in the
palace now than before? When he finds out also that
we have reported his presence to the king his mind will
become hot against us, and he will without doubt return
and destroy all our houses and kill everybody in
our village. Nay, it is better to give him silver and
beg him begone elsewhere," so although they told the
messengers of the king they would follow his words,
they simply held their peace when the dreaded robber
chief was near their village.</p>

<p>But after a long time the headman of Myo Haung,
who was braver than his fellows, came to the palace
and told the king that the <i>boh</i> was then at his village,
and would leave when it became dark, taking boat for
Myo Kywe, which was a suburb of the city of Pagan.</p>

<p>The heart of the king was filled with joy when he
heard this piece of good news, and he gave the headman
a great reward. Also he took off the royal robes such
as is the custom of kings to wear, and put on very poor
ones so that no one would think that he was the lord
who ate the country of Pagan. He also took with him
a sword; not the royal sword with the silver sheath
and ivory handle, but an old dah with a wooden handle
bound around with rattan string, and a sheath of wood,
such as the common people carry, then he went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bank of the river near Myo Kywe and waited. He
waited long, but his heart was strong and he did not
become discouraged by reason of the waiting, and at
last he saw coming down the river a small boat, and in
it a man whom he knew immediately to be the thief.</p>

<p>Maung Lek Byah guided his boat toward the bank
near where the king was seated, for he was a skillful
oarsman, and when he had fastened it with a rattan
loop to the end of his oar stuck into the soft mud at
the water's edge he ascended the path to the village,
and as he reached the top of the bank he caught sight
of the king in his dingy clothes and wearing the old
sword with the wooden handle, sitting on the side of
the path.</p>

<p>He was surprised to see a man there at that time of
night, for the gongs which call the priests and old
women to worship had sounded long before, and everybody
in the village was sound asleep, therefore he gazed
earnestly at the king and then called out:</p>

<p>"Who is that?"</p>

<p>"It is a man who wishes to arrive at the rank of
disciple to our lord," replied the king.</p>

<p>"Art thou a man of the day or a man of the
night?" asked the robber looking down at him.</p>

<p>"Thy servant is a man of the night," replied the
king.</p>

<p>"Hast thou not heard how many of my followers
have been caught and executed? How that the tigers
at the entering in of the villages will not now eat oxen
but wait till one of my men is tied up for them? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
tell thee they have not long to wait either. Art thou
not afraid?"</p>

<p>"Ah, our lord," replied the king, "thy disciples
suffered because they did not take heed and follow in
the footsteps of our lord, therefore have they arrived
at destruction; but thy servant will study thee, O
payah, and thus will I learn how to become a great
<i>boh</i> and also to escape their fate."</p>

<p>Now when the king talked in this fashion the <i>boh</i>
was very pleased with him, and gave him permission
to follow. He also promised to teach his new disciple
all his arts; that he would not let him ever be
caught and would make him as famous a <i>boh</i> even as
he was. "And so," said he, "as thou hast a sword
with thee, follow me. I will give thee thy first lesson."</p>

<p>Now it happened that as they walked along toward
the city the thief began to think within himself, "Who
can this new disciple be? He surely comes from a
high family, for he speaks not like the common people,
but as kings have a custom of speaking. He wears the
clothes of a common man, and carries the sword of a
coolie, but yet his words are the words of one used to
command. Can he be a spy sent by the <i>amat</i> whom I
tricked so nicely the other day, I wonder?" and thus
he turned it over and over in his mind.</p>

<p>The <i>hpeas</i> have ever aided the kings of Burma, and
now those whom the king had been in the habit of
feeding daily were watching over him, and when they
heard the <i>boh</i> thus talk with himself, for the spirits
can hear us think even when we make no sounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
words, they put it into the head of the robber to go to
the house of the king's own astrologer. It was not
very far and they soon arrived there. Then Maung
Lek Byah said to the king:</p>

<p>"Stay thou here and watch; if thou dost see or hear
aught come and call me," but he himself went under
the house of the astrologer to discover whether he slept
or not. When he knew that the man was sound asleep
he would draw a sharp knife which he carried in his
girdle, cut a hole in the mat side of the house, creep
in through this hole and take what he wished; then he
would escape before the lord of the house awoke.</p>

<p>As he was watching, however, he heard the astrologer
come out upon the veranda so that he could study the
stars, for that was his custom; then he heard him say
to himself:</p>

<p>"Truly this is a good thing to marvel at, for I see
the star of that famous robber chief, Boh Lek Byah,
and following it closely is the star of none other than
the ruler of the Golden Palace himself."</p>

<p>For a long time the astrologer sat upon his veranda
pondering over this strange occurrence and trying to
think what it should portend; but in vain. He could
think of no solution of the mystery, so after again saying
that it was a good thing to marvel at he gave it up and
went into his house to sleep.</p>

<p>Thus did the thief discover the high rank of his new
disciple, for the astrologer knew the star of the <i>boh</i> well
and would make no mistake. He also knew the star
of the king. Had this same astrologer not cast the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
horoscope of the robber chief and foretold which days
were lucky and which unlucky to him, so that by taking
heed he had never been caught? Therefore when
he again came forth from under the royal astrologer's
house and saw the king was still waiting without, even as
he had given orders, his mind was filled with great fear.</p>

<p>Then said the king directly he saw the robber: "O
Kin Byah, thy servant knows a place where there are so
many rubies that they are as common as <i>maknin</i> seeds
that the children play with in the dust; gold is as
plentiful as iron is with us, and there is enough silk to
stock ten bazaars. All this is within reach of our
hands. I can guide thee to the place, for I know it
well; wilt thou follow?"</p>

<p>Then said the thief: "I know of but one place of
which thou canst say that with truth, and that is the
Golden Palace; but a man may not enter there and
live. Knowest thou not that the guards carry sharp
<i>dahs</i>, and that if a man is caught there without permission
from the king or one of his <i>amats</i>, he is immediately
impaled? In very truth it is a place good to
shun and fear greatly, even as the den of a hungry
tiger in the jungle."</p>

<p>"True, O brave man," replied the king, "but this
evening as I passed by the palace I saw hanging from
the top of the wall a rope-ladder; we can climb over,
take enough to make us rich for the rest of our lives,
and run away before the guards with the sharp <i>dahs</i>
discover that we have been there. Thus shall we earn
much wealth and glory, and people throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
land will call our lord the 'Boh Who Entered the
Golden Palace,' and all men will fear his name more
than the name of a hungry leopard."</p>

<p>Then were the thoughts of the <i>boh</i> in great confusion,
and he said to himself: "Of a truth I am about
to arrive at destruction at last. I have had my last
adventure. If I do not follow the king he will assuredly
call out to the guard and I shall be taken. If
I go, how shall I be delivered from the great dangers
which will surround me in the Golden Palace? I am
undone whichever way I take."</p>

<p>Then said he to the king: "O disciple, whom I love
much, I fear to enter the Golden Palace, for this I perceive
is one of my unlucky days. We will therefore
go to Pin Tha village, for I saw this morning a great
number of coolies there. They were following a great
prince from the hills. They have been traveling far to-day
and are therefore heavy with sleep, and we can
despoil them of as much as we can carry away. As
they are very weary with their journey, none will know
aught till they awake in the morning."</p>

<p>"Upon what day wast thou born?" demanded the
king, and the <i>boh</i> said that it was upon a Saturday.</p>

<p>"Then," said the king, "behold! this is a lucky
day," and he drew forth from under his jacket a horoscope,
which showed that this was a lucky day upon
which a man who had been born upon a Saturday
could undertake any deed requiring great wisdom and
bravery in its accomplishment, and in spite of all that
Maung Lek Byah could say the king led the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
toward the palace, and the <i>boh</i> was obliged to follow
him, which he did with very slow and hesitating steps,
for his heart had become as weak as water.</p>

<p>Even as the king had said, there was a rope-ladder
hanging over the palace wall, and the <i>boh</i> perceived in
what manner the king had left the Golden Palace, but
being a very wise man he followed without opening his
mouth.</p>

<p>They passed through the palace courtyard and saw
there a thing good to marvel at; all the guards who
ought to have been watching their lord were slumbering,
so that the king and the <i>boh</i> gathered up all the
spears and <i>dahs</i> belonging to these men and carried
them away, hiding them in a secret place under one of
the houses.</p>

<p>As they entered the palace buildings the thief became
so full of alarm that all his strength left him and
he could hardly walk. Then the king saw that his
follower had arrived at great fear, and as they passed
the house where the royal food was prepared, he said:</p>

<p>"Friend, I perceive that thou art in sore distress;
come, eat the food I am about to prepare for thee and
thou wilt become strong."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the <i>boh</i>, "that I cannot do. Can a
common man eat of the golden food and live? This
will I not do; surely I should be accounted worthy of
death." The king would not listen to him, but entered
the royal kitchen, and with his own hands cooked
some food which he compelled the thief to eat.</p>

<p>Now, the king had prepared two messes, one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
which he had cunningly placed some opium and one
without, and it was the food which contained the opium
that the king gave to the <i>boh</i>. Therefore, after a little
time, he said to the king:</p>

<p>"O disciple of mine, I know not what is the matter
with me. I have no strength and although it is death
to sleep in the Golden Palace yet must I sleep, for if I
do not I shall surely die."</p>

<p>As he said these words his head drooped upon his
chest, his eyes closed and he fell asleep. Once more
was the heart of the king filled with joy and he bound
the <i>boh</i> with strong ropes in great haste and made him
a prisoner.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the king called the officer
who was in charge of the guard the night before and
when he was come before the face of his majesty, the
king said:</p>

<p>"I have a parable to tell thee. Once upon a time
there was a great king and in his country was also a
famous robber chief and, behold, one night the king
was sore troubled with questions of statecraft so that he
could not sleep, therefore he walked throughout his
palace. As he was passing through the courtyard he
spied a ladder hanging from the top of the wall. Now
the thief of whom I have spoken had that very night
entered the Golden Palace and at that same moment
the king caught sight of him, loaded down with plunder,
creeping toward the rope ladder beside which he
stood. Then the king fell upon him and took him
prisoner, bound him securely with strong ropes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
dragged him to a safe place; but the soldiers who should
have been watching were all asleep. What should be
done to such guards as these?"</p>

<p>Now the officer did not yet know that the <i>dahs</i> of his
men had been stolen, so bowing before the Golden Foot,
he replied:</p>

<p>"Head of thy servant's body, there is but one thing
to be done, they are worthy of death. Their lord should
pass judgment upon them without mercy and that immediately."</p>

<p>"That is a good judgment," replied the king, and
turning again to the officer of the guard, he said:</p>

<p>"Last night I saw the great and renowned robber
chief, Boh Lek Byah, in this palace. I took him prisoner
with mine own hands, behold, he lies tied fast
with ropes in yonder room, but all the guards who
should have been watching were asleep. Where are
their <i>dahs</i>? Let every man who has no sword be impaled
before I eat my morning rice."</p>

<p>Then were the hearts of the king's <i>amats</i> full of joy
when they heard that the thief whom they all feared
was a prisoner in the palace, and they praised the wondrous
bravery and subtlety of their royal master, saying
that without doubt he was the bravest and wisest
king who ever sat under a white umbrella.</p>

<p>The king was very proud as he listened to their
praises and gave orders that the robber chief should be
brought before him.</p>

<p>When Boh Lek Byah was led to the Golden Foot he
prostrated himself, and the king said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"If a man be found in the royal palace at night
what hath custom decreed should be the punishment
for his presumption?"</p>

<p>Then the prisoner said: "King above all kings, it is
death."</p>

<p>"Hast thou anything to say why thou shouldst not
be impaled or given to the tigers to eat?" demanded
the king in a terrible voice.</p>

<p>"Lord of the world," replied the unfortunate man,
"last night thou didst ask to become disciple to our
lord's slave. Will the disciple order his teacher to be
executed? When our lord's slave was beneath the
royal astrologer's house he discovered that his new disciple
was the Eater of the Country and so when our
lord of the Golden Palace ordered his slave to enter, he
would have been worthy of death had he not obeyed.
Will the Son of the Sun execute his slave for following
his words?"</p>

<p>Then when the king heard that the robber had
known who he really was, he marveled much at his
wisdom, and said:</p>

<p>"Assuredly thou art too wise a man for the tigers
to eat. Take thou yonder sword, it belonged to him
who yesterday was captain of the royal guard. Follow
me and thou shalt later become my chief <i>amat</i>."</p>
